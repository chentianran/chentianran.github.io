Stratified polyhedral homotopy
==============================

Picking up witness sets on our way to isolated solutions!

Abstract
--------

Numerical algebraic geometry revolves around the study of
solutions to polynomial systems via numerical method.
Two of the fundamental tools in this field are
the polyhedral homotopy of Huber and Sturmfels
for computing isolated solutions
and the concept of witness sets put forth by Sommese and Wampler
as numerical representations for non-isolated solution components.
In this talk, we will describe a stratified polyhedral homotopy method
that will bridge the gap between these two largely independent area.
Such a homotopy method will discover numerical representations of
non-isolated solution components
as by-products from the process of computing isolated solutions.
We will also outline the pipeline of numerical algorithms necessary to
implement this homotopy method on modern massively parallel computing architecture.

Power-flow equations model the intricate balancing conditions in electric power grids and are central to analysis and control.  They can be reformulated as Laurent polynomial systems, which makes algebraic and polyhedral techniques applicable.  In this talk, we first explore different ways in which this can be done.

However, certain algebraic formulations may be deficient: the actual number of isolated solutions (counting multiplicity) may fall below the Bernshtein–Kushnirenko–Khovanskii (BKK) bound predicted from Newton polytopes.  By choosing a proper parametrization one uncovers that this deficiency exhibits a certain toric structure.  Recognizing that structure reframes the deficit as a geometric feature rather than a numerical anomaly.  In the second part of this talk, we explore variations of polyhedral homotopy methods designed to respect and exploit this structure.

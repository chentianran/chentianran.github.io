    Belief propagation (BP) is an iterative method to perform approximate
    inference on arbitrary graphical models.
    Whether BP converges and if the solution is a unique fixed point depends
    on both the structure and the parametrization of the model.
    To understand this dependence it is interesting to find all fixed points.

    Active research activity in power systems areas has focused on
    developing computational methods to solve load flow equations
    where a key question is the maximum number of solutions.
    Though several upper bounds exist, recent studies have hinted that
    much sharper upper bounds that depend the topology of underlying
    power networks may exist.
    This paper provides a significant refinement of these observations.
    We also develop a geometric construction called adjacency polytope
    which accurately captures the topology of a power network
    and is immensely useful in the computation of the solution bound.
    Finally we highlight the significant implications of the development
    of such solution bounds in numerically solving load flow equations.

    This article presents recent efforts in improving the efficiency
    and scalability of the mixed cell computation step in the context of
    the Polyhedral Homotopy method.
    Solving systems of polynomial equations is an important problem
    in applied mathematics.
    The Polyhedral Homotopy method is an important numerical method for this task.
    In this method, a necessary preprocessing step, known as the
    "mixed cell computation" problem has been the main bottleneck in the
    parallel efficiency and scalability.
    This article presents recent remarkable improvements in the
    parallel scalability of the algorithm that are applicable to
    a wide range of hardware architectures including multi-core systems,
    NUMA systems, computer clusters, and GPUs devices.

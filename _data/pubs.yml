    Adjacency polytopes, a.k.a. symmetric edge polytopes,
    associated with undirected graphs have been defined and studied
    in several seemingly-independent areas including
    number theory, discrete geometry, and dynamical systems.
    In particular, the authors are motivated by the study of
    the algebraic Kuramoto equations of unmixed form
    whose Newton polytopes are the adjacency polytopes.

    The interplay between the geometric structure of adjacency polytopes
    and the topological structure of the underlying graphs is a recurring theme
    in recent studies.
    In particular, "facet/face subgraphs" emerged as one of the central concepts
    in describing this symmetry.
    Continuing along this line of inquiry we provide a complete description of
    the correspondence between facets/faces of an adjacency polytope
    and maximal bipartite subgraphs of the underlying connected graph.

    The study of frequency synchronization configurations in Kuramoto models is a
    ubiquitous mathematical problem that has found applications in many seemingly
    independent fields. In this paper, we focus on networks whose underlying graph
    are cycle graphs. Based on the recent result on the upper bound of the
    frequency synchronization configurations in this context, we propose a toric
    deformation homotopy method for locating all frequency synchronization
    configurations with complexity that is linear in this upper bound. Loosely
    based on the polyhedral homotopy method, this homotopy induces a deformation of
    the set of the synchronization configurations into a series of toric varieties,
    yet our method has the distinct advantage of avoiding the costly step of
    computing mixed cells. We also explore the important consequences of this
    homotopy method in the context of direct acyclic decomposition of Kuramoto
    networks and tropical stable intersection points for Kuramoto equations.

    Adjacency polytopes of graphs appear naturally in the study of 
    nonlinear emergent phenomenon in complex networks. 
    The "type-PV" adjacency polytope, also known as a symmetric edge polytope, 
    arises in the study of Kuramoto equations. 
    The "type-PQ" adjacency polytope of the graph G, denote by $\nabla^{PQ}_G$, 
    which is the focus of this work, encodes rich combinatorial information 
    about power-flow solutions in sparse power networks 
    that are studied in electric engineering.
    Of particular importance is the normalized volume of such an adjacency polytope, 
    which provides an upper bound on the number of distinct power-flow solutions.
    In this article we show that the problem of computing normalized volumes 
    for the type-PQ adjacency polytopes can be rephrased as the problem of 
    counting $D(G)$-draconian sequences where $D(G)$ is a certain bipartite graph 
    associated to the network. 
    We provide recurrences for all networks with connectivity as most 1 and, 
    for 2-connected graphs, we give, under an additional mild restriction, 
    recurrences for subdividing an edge and taking the join of an edge 
    with a new vertex. 
    Together, these recurrences imply a simple, non-recursive formula 
    for the normalized volume of $\nabla^{PQ}_G$ when $G$ is part of a large class of outerplanar graphs; 
    we conjecture that the formula holds for all outerplanar graphs. 
    Explicit formulas for several other (non-outerplanar) classes are given. 
    Further, we identify several important classes of graphs G which are planar 
    but not outerplanar worth additional study.

    By using the viewpoint of modern computational algebraic geometry,
    we explore properties of the optimization landscapes of the deep linear neural network models. 
    After clarifying on the various definitions of "flat" minima, we show that the geometrically flat minima, 
    which are merely artifacts of residual continuous symmetries of the deep linear networks, 
    can be straightforwardly removed by a generalized $L_2$ regularization. 
    Then, we establish upper bounds on the number of isolated stationary 
    points of these networks with the help of algebraic geometry. 
    Using these upper bounds and utilizing a numerical algebraic geometry method, 
    we find all stationary points for modest depth and matrix size. 
    We show that in the presence of the non-zero regularization, 
    deep linear networks indeed possess local minima which are not the global minima. 
    Our computational results further clarify certain aspects of the loss surfaces of deep linear networks and provides novel insights.

    The Kuramoto model is one of the most widely studied model for describing
    synchronization behaviors in a network of coupled oscillators, and it has found
    a wide range of applications. Finding all possible frequency synchronization
    configurations in a general non-uniform heterogeneous sparse network is an
    important yet difficult problem due to the complicated nonlinear interactions.
    In this paper, we develop a general framework for decomposing a Kuramoto
    network into smaller directed acyclic subnetworks that will form the foundation
    of a divide-and-conquer approach for studying the frequency synchronization
    configurations of large Kuramoto networks.

    Computing mixed volume of convex polytopes is an important problem
    in computational algebraic geometry.
    This paper establishes sufficient conditions under which the mixed volume
    of several convex polytopes exactly equals the normalized volume of the
    convex hull of their union.
    Under these conditions the problem of computing mixed volume of
    several polytopes can be transformed into a volume computation problem
    for a single polytope in the same dimension.
    We demonstrate through problems from real world applications that
    substantial reduction in computational costs can be achieved via
    this transformation in situations where the convex hull of the union
    of the polytopes has less complex geometry than the original polytopes.
    We also discuss the important implications of this result in the
    polyhedral homotopy method for solving polynomial systems.

    libtropicon: A Scalable Library for Computing

  journal: Mathematical Software -- ICMS 2018

  abstract: >
    The computation of intersection points of generic tropical hyper-surfaces 
    is a fundamental problem in computational algebraic geometry. 
    An efficient algorithm for solving this problem will be a basic building block 
    in many higher level algorithms for studying tropical varieties, 
    computing mixed volume, enumerating mixed cells, constructing polyhedral homotopies, etc. 
    libtropicon is a library for computing intersection points of generic tropical hyper-surfaces 
    that provides a unified framework where the several conceptually opposite approaches coexist 
    and complement one another. 
    In particular, great efficiency is achieve by the data cross-feeding of the ``pivoting'' 
    and the ``elimination'' step --- data by-product generated by the pivoting step is selectively 
    saved to bootstrap the elimination step, and vice versa. 
    The core algorithm is designed to be naturally parallel and highly scalable, 
    and the implementation directly supports multi-core architectures, computer clusters, 
    and GPUs based on CUDA or ROCm/OpenCL technology. 
    Many-core architectures such as Intel Xeon Phi are also partially supported. 
    This library also includes interface layers that allows it to be tightly integrated into the 
    existing ecosystem of software in computational algebraic geometry.

    Active research activity in power systems areas has focused on

    where a key question is the maximum number of solutions.
    Though several upper bounds exist, recent studies have hinted that
    much sharper upper bounds that depend the topology of underlying
    power networks may exist.
    This paper provides a significant refinement of these observations.
    We also develop a geometric construction called adjacency polytope
    which accurately captures the topology of a power network
    and is immensely useful in the computation of the solution bound.
    Finally we highlight the significant implications of the development
    of such solution bounds in numerically solving load flow equations.

    Solution sets of systems of binomial equations are of great interest
    in applied mathematics. For both theoretic and applied purposes,
    the degree of a solution set (its maximum number of isolated intersections
    with an affine space of complementary dimension) often plays an important role
    in understanding its geometric structure.
    This paper proposes a specialized parallel algorithm for computing the degree
    on GPUs that takes advantage of the massively parallel nature of GPU devices.
    The preliminary implementation shows remarkable efficiency and scalability
    when compared to the closest CPU-based counterpart.
    As a case study, the algorithm is applied to the master space problem of
    N = 1 gauge theories.
    The GPU-based implementation achieves nearly 30 fold speedup over its
    CPU-only counterpart enabling the discovery of previously unknown results.

    Locating the stationary points of a real-valued multivariate potential
    energy function is an important problem in many areas of science.
    This task generally amounts to solving simultaneous nonlinear systems
    of equations.
    While there are several numerical methods that can find many or
    all stationary points, they each exhibit characteristic problems.
    Moreover, traditional methods tend to perform poorly near degenerate
    stationary points with additional zero Hessian eigenvalues.
    We propose an efficient and robust implementation of the
    Newton homotopy method, which is capable of quickly sampling
    a large number of stationary points of a wide range of indices,
    as well as degenerate stationary points.
    We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the Thomson problem.
    We also briefly discuss a possible connection between the present work
    and Smale's 7th problem.

    We analyze the computation of mixed volume of tuples of polytopes via
    fine mixed subdivisions.
    This method expresses the mixed volume as a sum of easily computable
    standard volumes of polytopes called mixed cells.
    Mixed cells play a critically important role in
    polyhedral homotopy continuation method, which in turn is a
    particularly efficient numerical method for the solution of systems
    of polynomial equations.
    We provide a complete and self-contained account of the underlying
    computational convexity techniques, assuming no background in
    algebraic geometry.

    One of the most challenging and frequently arising problems in many areas
    of science is to find solutions of a system of multivariate nonlinear equations.
    There are several numerical methods that can find many (or all if the system
    is small enough) solutions but they all exhibit characteristic problems.
    Moreover, traditional methods can break down if the system contains
    singular solutions.
    Here, we propose an efficient implementation of Newton homotopies, which
    can sample a large number of the stationary points of complicated
    many-body potentials.
    We demonstrate how the procedure works by applying it to the nearest-neighbor
    ϕ4 model and atomic clusters.

    Homotopy continuation methods have been proved to be an efficient and
    reliable class of numerical methods for solving systems of polynomial
    equations which occur frequently in various fields of mathematics, science,
    and engineering.
    Based on the successful software package Hom4PS-2.0 for solving such
    polynomial systems, Hom4PS-3 has a new fully modular design which allows
    it to be easily extended.
    It implements many different numerical homotopy methods including the
    Polyhedral Homotopy continuation method.
    Furthermore, it is capable of carrying out computation in parallel on a
    wide range of hardware architectures including multi-core systems,
    computer clusters, distributed environments, and GPUs with
    great efficiency and scalability.
    Designed to be user-friendly, it includes interfaces to a variety of
    existing mathematical software and programming languages such as
    Python, Ruby, Octave, Sage and Matlab.

    Efficient algorithms for computing mixed volumes, via the computation of
    mixed cells, have been implemented in DEMiCs and MixedVol-2.0.
    While the approaches in those two packages are somewhat different,
    they follow the same theme and are both highly serial.
    To fit the need for the parallel computing, a reformulation of
    the algorithms is inevitable.
    This article proposes a reformulation of the algorithm for the mixed volume
    computation rooted from algorithms in graph theory, making it much more
    fine-grained and scalable.
    The resulting parallel algorithm can be readily adapted to both distributed
    and shared memory computing systems.
    Illustrated by the numerical results on several different architectures,
    the speedups of our parallel algorithms for the mixed volume computation
    are remarkable.

    Solving systems of polynomial equations is an important problem in
    mathematics with a wide range of applications in many fields.
    The homotopy continuation method is a large class of reliable and
    efficient numerical methods for solving systems of polynomial equations.
    An essential component in the homotopy continuation method is the
    path tracking algorithm for tracking smooth paths of one real dimension.
    In this regard, “divergent paths” pose a tough challenge as the tracking
    of such paths is generally impossible.
    The existence of such paths is, in part, caused by \(\mathbb{C}^n\),
    the space in which homotopy methods usually operate, being non-compact.
    A well known remedy is to operate inside the complex projective space
    \(\mathbb{CP}^n\) instead.
    Path tracking inside \(\mathbb{CP}^n\) is the focus of this article.
    Taking the Riemannian geometry of \(\mathbb{CP}^n\) into account,
    we derive the basic algorithm for projective path tracking using the sphere,
    \(S^{2n+1}\), as the model of computation.
    Remarkable results from numerical experiments using this method are presented.

  abstract: >
    Belief propagation (BP) is an iterative method to perform approximate
    inference on arbitrary graphical models.
    Whether BP converges and if the solution is a unique fixed point depends
    on both the structure and the parametrization of the model.
    To understand this dependence it is interesting to find all fixed points.

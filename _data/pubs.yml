    Computing mixed volume of convex polytopes is an important problem
    in computational algebraic geometry.
    This paper establishes sufficient conditions under which the mixed volume
    of several convex polytopes exactly equals the normalized volume of the
    convex hull of their union.
    Under these conditions the problem of computing mixed volume of
    several polytopes can be transformed into a volume computation problem
    for a single polytope in the same dimension.
    We demonstrate through problems from real world applications that
    substantial reduction in computational costs can be achieved via
    this transformation in situations where the convex hull of the union
    of the polytopes has less complex geometry than the original polytopes.
    We also discuss the important implications of this result in the
    polyhedral homotopy method for solving polynomial systems.

    Synchronization in networks of interconnected oscillators is a
    fascinating phenomenon that appear naturally in many independent fields
    of science and engineering.
    A substantial amount of work has been devoted to understanding
    all possible synchronization configurations on a given network.
    In this setting, a key problem is to determine the total number of
    such configurations.
    Through an algebraic formulation, for tree and cycle graphs,
    we provide an upper bound on this number using the
    birationally invariant intersection index of a
    system of rational functions on a toric variety.

    libtropicon: A Scalable Library for Computing 
    Intersection Points of Generic Tropical Hyper-surfaces

  abstract: >
    The computation of intersection points of generic tropical hyper-surfaces 
    is a fundamental problem in computational algebraic geometry. 
    An efficient algorithm for solving this problem will be a basic building block 
    in many higher level algorithms for studying tropical varieties, 
    computing mixed volume, enumerating mixed cells, constructing polyhedral homotopies, etc. 
    libtropicon is a library for computing intersection points of generic tropical hyper-surfaces 
    that provides a unified framework where the several conceptually opposite approaches coexist 
    and complement one another. 
    In particular, great efficiency is achieve by the data cross-feeding of the ``pivoting'' 
    and the ``elimination'' step --- data by-product generated by the pivoting step is selectively 
    saved to bootstrap the elimination step, and vice versa. 
    The core algorithm is designed to be naturally parallel and highly scalable, 
    and the implementation directly supports multi-core architectures, computer clusters, 
    and GPUs based on CUDA or ROCm/OpenCL technology. 
    Many-core architectures such as Intel Xeon Phi are also partially supported. 
    This library also includes interface layers that allows it to be tightly integrated into the 
    existing ecosystem of software in computational algebraic geometry.

    Belief propagation (BP) is an iterative method to perform approximate

    Whether BP converges and if the solution is a unique fixed point depends
    on both the structure and the parametrization of the model.
    To understand this dependence it is interesting to find all fixed points.

  abstract: >
    Active research activity in power systems areas has focused on
    developing computational methods to solve load flow equations
    where a key question is the maximum number of solutions.
    Though several upper bounds exist, recent studies have hinted that
    much sharper upper bounds that depend the topology of underlying
    power networks may exist.
    This paper provides a significant refinement of these observations.
    We also develop a geometric construction called adjacency polytope
    which accurately captures the topology of a power network
    and is immensely useful in the computation of the solution bound.
    Finally we highlight the significant implications of the development
    of such solution bounds in numerically solving load flow equations.

    Solving systems of polynomial equations is an important problem
    in applied mathematics.
    The Polyhedral Homotopy method is an important numerical method for this task.
    In this method, a necessary preprocessing step, known as the
    "mixed cell computation" problem has been the main bottleneck in the
    parallel efficiency and scalability.
    This article presents recent remarkable improvements in the
    parallel scalability of the algorithm that are applicable to
    a wide range of hardware architectures including multi-core systems,
    NUMA systems, computer clusters, and GPUs devices.

  abstract: >
    Solution sets of systems of binomial equations are of great interest
    in applied mathematics. For both theoretic and applied purposes,
    the degree of a solution set (its maximum number of isolated intersections
    with an affine space of complementary dimension) often plays an important role
    in understanding its geometric structure.
    This paper proposes a specialized parallel algorithm for computing the degree
    on GPUs that takes advantage of the massively parallel nature of GPU devices.
    The preliminary implementation shows remarkable efficiency and scalability
    when compared to the closest CPU-based counterpart.
    As a case study, the algorithm is applied to the master space problem of
    N = 1 gauge theories.
    The GPU-based implementation achieves nearly 30 fold speedup over its
    CPU-only counterpart enabling the discovery of previously unknown results.

    Locating the stationary points of a real-valued multivariate potential
    energy function is an important problem in many areas of science.
    This task generally amounts to solving simultaneous nonlinear systems
    of equations.
    While there are several numerical methods that can find many or
    all stationary points, they each exhibit characteristic problems.
    Moreover, traditional methods tend to perform poorly near degenerate
    stationary points with additional zero Hessian eigenvalues.
    We propose an efficient and robust implementation of the
    Newton homotopy method, which is capable of quickly sampling
    a large number of stationary points of a wide range of indices,
    as well as degenerate stationary points.
    We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the Thomson problem.
    We also briefly discuss a possible connection between the present work
    and Smale's 7th problem.

    Homotopy continuation methods have been proved to be an efficient and

    it to be easily extended.
    It implements many different numerical homotopy methods including the
    Polyhedral Homotopy continuation method.
    Furthermore, it is capable of carrying out computation in parallel on a
    wide range of hardware architectures including multi-core systems,
    computer clusters, distributed environments, and GPUs with
    great efficiency and scalability.
    Designed to be user-friendly, it includes interfaces to a variety of

    Efficient algorithms for computing mixed volumes, via the computation of
    mixed cells, have been implemented in DEMiCs and MixedVol-2.0.
    While the approaches in those two packages are somewhat different,
    they follow the same theme and are both highly serial.
    To fit the need for the parallel computing, a reformulation of
    the algorithms is inevitable.
    This article proposes a reformulation of the algorithm for the mixed volume
    computation rooted from algorithms in graph theory, making it much more
    fine-grained and scalable.
    The resulting parallel algorithm can be readily adapted to both distributed
    and shared memory computing systems.
    Illustrated by the numerical results on several different architectures,
    the speedups of our parallel algorithms for the mixed volume computation
    are remarkable.

    Solving systems of polynomial equations is an important problem in
    mathematics with a wide range of applications in many fields.
    The homotopy continuation method is a large class of reliable and
    efficient numerical methods for solving systems of polynomial equations.
    An essential component in the homotopy continuation method is the
    path tracking algorithm for tracking smooth paths of one real dimension.
    In this regard, “divergent paths” pose a tough challenge as the tracking
    of such paths is generally impossible.
    The existence of such paths is, in part, caused by \(\mathbb{C}^n\),
    the space in which homotopy methods usually operate, being non-compact.
    A well known remedy is to operate inside the complex projective space
    \(\mathbb{CP}^n\) instead.
    Path tracking inside \(\mathbb{CP}^n\) is the focus of this article.
    Taking the Riemannian geometry of \(\mathbb{CP}^n\) into account,
    we derive the basic algorithm for projective path tracking using the sphere,
    \(S^{2n+1}\), as the model of computation.
    Remarkable results from numerical experiments using this method are presented.

    Belief propagation (BP) is an iterative method to perform approximate
    inference on arbitrary graphical models.
    Whether BP converges and if the solution is a unique fixed point depends
    on both the structure and the parametrization of the model.
    To understand this dependence it is interesting to find all fixed points.

    Active research activity in power systems areas has focused on
    developing computational methods to solve load flow equations
    where a key question is the maximum number of solutions.
    Though several upper bounds exist, recent studies have hinted that
    much sharper upper bounds that depend the topology of underlying
    power networks may exist.
    This paper provides a significant refinement of these observations.
    We also develop a geometric construction called adjacency polytope
    which accurately captures the topology of a power network
    and is immensely useful in the computation of the solution bound.
    Finally we highlight the significant implications of the development
    of such solution bounds in numerically solving load flow equations.

    This article presents recent efforts in improving the efficiency
    and scalability of the mixed cell computation step in the context of
    the Polyhedral Homotopy method.
    Solving systems of polynomial equations is an important problem
    in applied mathematics.
    The Polyhedral Homotopy method is an important numerical method for this task.
    In this method, a necessary preprocessing step, known as the
    "mixed cell computation" problem has been the main bottleneck in the
    parallel efficiency and scalability.
    This article presents recent remarkable improvements in the
    parallel scalability of the algorithm that are applicable to
    a wide range of hardware architectures including multi-core systems,
    NUMA systems, computer clusters, and GPUs devices.

  abstract: >
    Solution sets of systems of binomial equations are of great interest
    in applied mathematics. For both theoretic and applied purposes,
    the degree of a solution set (its maximum number of isolated intersections
    with an affine space of complementary dimension) often plays an important role
    in understanding its geometric structure.
    This paper proposes a specialized parallel algorithm for computing the degree
    on GPUs that takes advantage of the massively parallel nature of GPU devices.
    The preliminary implementation shows remarkable efficiency and scalability
    when compared to the closest CPU-based counterpart.
    As a case study, the algorithm is applied to the master space problem of
    N = 1 gauge theories.
    The GPU-based implementation achieves nearly 30 fold speedup over its
    CPU-only counterpart enabling the discovery of previously unknown results.

    The comment notes that the Newton homotopy (NH) and Newton trajectory (NT)
    methods are related.
    By describing recent implementations of the NH method, we clarify the
    similarities and differences between the two approaches.
    The possible synergy between NH, NT and other flow methods could suggest
    further developments in mathematics and chemistry.

    Locating the stationary points of a real-valued multivariate potential
    energy function is an important problem in many areas of science.
    This task generally amounts to solving simultaneous nonlinear systems
    of equations.
    While there are several numerical methods that can find many or
    all stationary points, they each exhibit characteristic problems.
    Moreover, traditional methods tend to perform poorly near degenerate
    stationary points with additional zero Hessian eigenvalues.
    We propose an efficient and robust implementation of the
    Newton homotopy method, which is capable of quickly sampling
    a large number of stationary points of a wide range of indices,
    as well as degenerate stationary points.
    We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the Thomson problem.
    We also briefly discuss a possible connection between the present work
    and Smale's 7th problem.

    We analyze the computation of mixed volume of tuples of polytopes via
    fine mixed subdivisions.
    This method expresses the mixed volume as a sum of easily computable
    standard volumes of polytopes called mixed cells.
    Mixed cells play a critically important role in
    polyhedral homotopy continuation method, which in turn is a
    particularly efficient numerical method for the solution of systems
    of polynomial equations.
    We provide a complete and self-contained account of the underlying
    computational convexity techniques, assuming no background in
    algebraic geometry.

    One of the most challenging and frequently arising problems in many areas
    of science is to find solutions of a system of multivariate nonlinear equations.
    There are several numerical methods that can find many (or all if the system
    is small enough) solutions but they all exhibit characteristic problems.
    Moreover, traditional methods can break down if the system contains
    singular solutions.
    Here, we propose an efficient implementation of Newton homotopies, which
    can sample a large number of the stationary points of complicated
    many-body potentials.
    We demonstrate how the procedure works by applying it to the nearest-neighbor
    ϕ4 model and atomic clusters.

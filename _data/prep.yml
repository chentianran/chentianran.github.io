  abstract: > 
    The Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii theorem provides a generic root count
    for system of Laurent polynomials in terms of the mixed volume of their Newton polytopes
    which has since been known as the BKK bound.
    A recent and far-reaching generalization of this theorem is the study of
    birationally invariant intersection index by Kaveh and Khovanskii.
    In this paper we generalize the BKK bound
    in the direction of the birationally invariant intersection index,
    and the main result allows the application of BKK bound to 
    Laurent polynomial systems that has algebraic relations among the coefficients.
    Applying this result, we establish the birationally invariant intersection index
    for a well-studied algebraic Kuramoto equations.

  title: The loss surface of deep linear networks viewed through the algebraic geometry lens

  abstract: >
    By using the viewpoint of modern computational algebraic geometry,
    we explore properties of the optimization landscapes of the deep linear neural network models. 
    After clarifying on the various definitions of "flat" minima, we show that the geometrically flat minima, 
    which are merely artifacts of residual continuous symmetries of the deep linear networks, 
    can be straightforwardly removed by a generalized $L_2$ regularization. 
    Then, we establish upper bounds on the number of isolated stationary 
    points of these networks with the help of algebraic geometry. 
    Using these upper bounds and utilizing a numerical algebraic geometry method, 
    we find all stationary points for modest depth and matrix size. 
    We show that in the presence of the non-zero regularization, 
    deep linear networks indeed possess local minima which are not the global minima. 
    Our computational results further clarify certain aspects of the loss surfaces of deep linear networks and provides novel insights.

  title: A toric deformation method for solving Kuramoto equations

  abstract: >
    The study of frequency synchronization configurations in Kuramoto models is a
    ubiquitous mathematical problem that has found applications in many seemingly
    independent fields. In this paper, we focus on networks whose underlying graph
    are cycle graphs. Based on the recent result on the upper bound of the
    frequency synchronization configurations in this context, we propose a toric
    deformation homotopy method for locating all frequency synchronization
    configurations with complexity that is linear in this upper bound. Loosely
    based on the polyhedral homotopy method, this homotopy induces a deformation of
    the set of the synchronization configurations into a series of toric varieties,
    yet our method has the distinct advantage of avoiding the costly step of
    computing mixed cells. We also explore the important consequences of this
    homotopy method in the context of direct acyclic decomposition of Kuramoto
    networks and tropical stable intersection points for Kuramoto equations.

  title: Unmixing the mixed volume computation
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01684
  abstract: >
    Computing mixed volume of convex polytopes is an important problem
    in computational algebraic geometry.
    This paper establishes sufficient conditions under which the mixed volume
    of several convex polytopes exactly equals the normalized volume of the
    convex hull of their union.
    Under these conditions the problem of computing mixed volume of
    several polytopes can be transformed into a volume computation problem
    for a single polytope in the same dimension.
    We demonstrate through problems from real world applications that
    substantial reduction in computational costs can be achieved via
    this transformation in situations where the convex hull of the union
    of the polytopes has less complex geometry than the original polytopes.
    We also discuss the important implications of this result in the
    polyhedral homotopy method for solving polynomial systems.

    A network topology dependent upper bound
    on the number of equilibria of the Kuramoto model

  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05905
  abstract: >
    We begin with formulating the stationary equations of the Kuramoto model
    as a system of polynomial equations in a novel way.
    Then, based on an algebraic geometric root count, we give a prescription
    of computing an upper bound on the number of equilibria of the
    Kuramoto model for the most general case, i.e., defined on an
    arbitrary graph and having generic values of natural frequencies
    and inhomogeneous couplings.
    We demonstrate with computational experiments utilizing the
    numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method that
    our bound is tight for the number of complex equilibria
    for the Kuramoto model in the most general case.
    We then discuss the implications or our results in relation to
    finding all the real equilibria of the Kuramoto model.

  title: An index-resolved fixed-point homotopy and potential energy landscapes
  coauthors: Dhagash Mehta
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06622
  abstract: >
    Stationary points (SPs) of the potential energy landscapes can be classified
    by their Morse index, i.e., the number of negative eigenvalues of the
    Hessian evaluated at the SPs.
    In understanding chemical clusters through their potential energy landscapes,
    only SPs of a particular Morse index are needed.
    We propose a modification of the "fixed-point homotopy" method which can be
    used to directly target stationary points of a specified Morse index.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the
    Lennard-Jones clusters.

  abstract: >
    Numerical algebraic geometry revolves around the study of
    solutions to polynomial systems via numerical method.
    The polyhedral homotopy of Huber and Sturmfels
    for computing isolated solutions
    and the concept of witness sets
    for as numerical representations of non-isolated solution components,
    put forth by Sommese and Wampler,
    are two of the fundamental tools in this field.
    In this paper, we show that a modified
    polyhedral homotopy can reveal sample sets
    of non-isolated solution components, akin to witness sets,
    as by-products from the process of computing isolated solutions.

    Numerical nonlinear algebra is a computational paradigm that uses numerical analysis to study polynomial equations. Its origins were methods to solve systems of polynomial equations based on the classical theorem of BÃ©zout. This was decisively linked to modern developments in algebraic geometry by the polyhedral homotopy algorithm of Huber and Sturmfels, which exploited the combinatorial structure of the equations and led to efficient software for solving polynomial equations. 
    Subsequent growth of numerical nonlinear algebra continues to be informed by algebraic geometry and its applications. These include new approaches to solving, algorithms for studying positive-dimensional varieties, certification, and a range of applications both within mathematics and from other disciplines. With new implementations, numerical nonlinear algebra is now a fundamental computational tool for algebraic geometry and its applications.

  abstract: > 
    The Kuramoto model is a dynamical system that models the interaction of coupled oscillators.
    There has been much work to effectively bound the number of equilibria to
    the Kuramoto model for a given network.
    By formulating the Kuramoto equations as a system of algebraic equations,
    we first relate the complex root count of the Kuramoto equations to the
    combinatorics of the underlying network by showing that the complex root count
    is generically equal to the normalized volume of the corresponding adjacency polytope of the network.
    We then give explicit algebraic conditions under which this bound is strict and show that there are conditions
    where the Kuramoto equations have infinitely many equilibria.

  title: GPU-accelerated path tracker for polyhedral homotopy
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14317
  abstract: >
    The polyhedral homotopy method of Huber and Sturmfels is a particularly
    efficient and robust numerical method for solving system of (Laurent)
    polynomial equations. A central component in an implementation of this method
    is an efficient and scalable path tracker. While the implementation issues in a
    scalable path tracker for computer clusters or multi-core CPUs have been solved
    thoroughly, designing good GPU-based implementations is still an active
    research topic. This paper addresses the core issue of efficiently evaluate a
    multivariate system of Laurent polynomials together with all its partial
    derivatives. We propose a simple approach that maps particularly well onto the
    parallel computing architectures of modern GPUs. As a by-product, we also
    simplify and accelerate the path tracker by consolidating the computation of
    Euler and Newton directions.

  title: On the root count of algebraic Kuramoto equations in cycle networks with uniform coupling

  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06241
  abstract: >
    The Kuramoto model is a classical model used in the study of
    spontaneous synchronizations in networks of coupled oscillators.
    In this model, frequency synchronization configurations can be formulated
    as complex solutions to a system of algebraic equations.
    Recently, upper bounds to the number of frequency synchronization configurations 
    in cycle networks of N oscillators  were calculated 
    under the assumption of generic non-uniform coupling.
    In this paper, we refine these results for the special cases of uniform coupling.
    In particular, we show that when, and only when, N is divisible by 4,
    the upper bound for the number of synchronization configurations
    in the uniform coupling cases is significantly less than 
    the bound in the non-uniform coupling cases.
    This result also establishes an explicit formula for the gap between
    the birationally invariant intersection index and the 
    Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii bound
    for the underlying algebraic equations.

  title: Graph edge contraction and adjacency polytopes

  arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02841
  abstract: >
    Adjacency polytopes, a.k.a. symmetric edge polytopes, associated with undirected graphs 
    have been proposed and studied in several seemingly independent areas ranging from 
    number theory to discrete geometry and the study of Kuramoto models. 
    Regular subdivisions of adjacency polytopes are of particular importance in 
    solving certain algebraic systems of equations. 
    This paper explores the connection between the regular subdivisions of an adjacency polytope 
    and the contraction of the underlying graph along an edge. 
    The main result is the construction of a special regular subdivision 
    whose cells are in one-to-one correspondence with facets of adjacency polytope 
    associated with an edge-contraction of the original graph.

  title: A geometric criterion on the equality between BKK bound and intersection
  pdf: bkk-biii.pdf
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05408
  abstract: > 
    The Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii theorem provides a generic root count
    for system of Laurent polynomials in terms of the mixed volume of their Newton polytopes
    (i.e., the BKK bound).
    A recent and far-reaching generalization of this theorem is the study of
    birationally invariant intersection index by Kaveh and Khovanskii.
    This short note establishes a simple geometric condition
    on the equality between the BKK bound and the intersection index
    for a system of vector spaces of Laurent polynomials.
    Applying this, we show that the intersection index
    for the algebraic Kuramoto equations equals their BKK bound.

  title: An index-resolved fixed-point homotopy and potential energy landscapes
  coauthors: Dhagash Mehta
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06622
  abstract: >
    Stationary points (SPs) of the potential energy landscapes can be classified
    by their Morse index, i.e., the number of negative eigenvalues of the
    Hessian evaluated at the SPs.
    In understanding chemical clusters through their potential energy landscapes,
    only SPs of a particular Morse index are needed.
    We propose a modification of the "fixed-point homotopy" method which can be
    used to directly target stationary points of a specified Morse index.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the
    Lennard-Jones clusters.

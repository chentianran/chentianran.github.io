  title: (Short note) Volume of convex polytopes equals mixed volume of simplices
  pdf: v-is-mv.pdf
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12875
  abstract: >
    This note provides a simple proof for the equality between the normalized
    volume of a convex polytope with $m$ vertices and the mixed volume of $m$
    simplices and thus shows the seemingly restrictive problem of computing mixed
    volume of simplices is still at least as hard as computing volumes of convex polytopes.

    Adjacency polytopes, a.k.a. symmetric edge polytopes,
    associated with undirected graphs have been defined and studied
    in several seemingly-independent areas including
    number theory, discrete geometry, and dynamical systems.
    In particular, the authors are motivated by the study of
    the algebraic Kuramoto equations of unmixed form
    whose Newton polytopes are the adjacency polytopes.

    The interplay between the geometric structure of adjacency polytopes
    and the topological structure of the underlying graphs is a recurring theme
    in recent studies.
    In particular, "facet/face subgraphs" emerged as one of the central concepts
    in describing this symmetry.
    Continuing along this line of inquiry we provide a complete description of
    the correspondence between facets/faces of an adjacency polytope
    and maximal bipartite subgraphs of the underlying connected graph.

  title: Computing volumes of adjacency polytopes via draconian sequences

  arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11051
  abstract: >
    Adjacency polytopes of graphs appear naturally in the study of 
    nonlinear emergent phenomenon in complex networks. 
    The "type-PV" adjacency polytope, also known as a symmetric edge polytope, 
    arises in the study of Kuramoto equations. 
    The "type-PQ" adjacency polytope of the graph G, denote by $\nabla^{PQ}_G$, 
    which is the focus of this work, encodes rich combinatorial information 
    about power-flow solutions in sparse power networks 
    that are studied in electric engineering.
    Of particular importance is the normalized volume of such an adjacency polytope, 
    which provides an upper bound on the number of distinct power-flow solutions.
    In this article we show that the problem of computing normalized volumes 
    for the type-PQ adjacency polytopes can be rephrased as the problem of 
    counting $D(G)$-draconian sequences where $D(G)$ is a certain bipartite graph 
    associated to the network. 
    We provide recurrences for all networks with connectivity as most 1 and, 
    for 2-connected graphs, we give, under an additional mild restriction, 
    recurrences for subdividing an edge and taking the join of an edge 
    with a new vertex. 
    Together, these recurrences imply a simple, non-recursive formula 
    for the normalized volume of $\nabla^{PQ}_G$ when $G$ is part of a large class of outerplanar graphs; 
    we conjecture that the formula holds for all outerplanar graphs. 
    Explicit formulas for several other (non-outerplanar) classes are given. 
    Further, we identify several important classes of graphs G which are planar 
    but not outerplanar worth additional study.

  title: On the root count of algebraic Kuramoto equations in cycle networks with uniform coupling
  coauthors: Evgeniia Korchevskaia

  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06241
  abstract: >
    The Kuramoto model is a classical model used in the study of
    spontaneous synchronizations in networks of coupled oscillators.
    In this model, frequency synchronization configurations can be formulated
    as complex solutions to a system of algebraic equations.
    Recently, upper bounds to the number of frequency synchronization configurations 
    in cycle networks of N oscillators  were calculated 
    under the assumption of generic non-uniform coupling.
    In this paper, we refine these results for the special cases of uniform coupling.
    In particular, we show that when, and only when, N is divisible by 4,
    the upper bound for the number of synchronization configurations
    in the uniform coupling cases is significantly less than 
    the bound in the non-uniform coupling cases.
    This result also establishes an explicit formula for the gap between
    the birationally invariant intersection index and the 
    Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii bound
    for the underlying algebraic equations.

  abstract: >
    Adjacency polytopes, a.k.a. symmetric edge polytopes, associated with undirected graphs 
    have been proposed and studied in several seemingly independent areas ranging from 
    number theory to discrete geometry and the study of Kuramoto models. 
    Regular subdivisions of adjacency polytopes are of particular importance in 
    solving certain algebraic systems of equations. 
    This paper explores the connection between the regular subdivisions of an adjacency polytope 
    and the contraction of the underlying graph along an edge. 
    The main result is the construction of a special regular subdivision 
    whose cells are in one-to-one correspondence with facets of adjacency polytope 
    associated with an edge-contraction of the original graph.

  title: On the equality of BKK bound and birationally invariant intersection index
  pdf: bkk-biii.pdf
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05408
  abstract: > 
    The Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii theorem provides a generic root count
    for system of Laurent polynomials in terms of the mixed volume of their Newton polytopes
    which has since been known as the BKK bound.
    A recent and far-reaching generalization of this theorem is the study of
    birationally invariant intersection index by Kaveh and Khovanskii.
    In this paper we generalize the BKK bound
    in the direction of the birationally invariant intersection index,
    and the main result allows the application of BKK bound to 
    Laurent polynomial systems that has algebraic relations among the coefficients.
    Applying this result, we establish the birationally invariant intersection index
    for a well-studied algebraic Kuramoto equations.

  abstract: >
    The study of frequency synchronization configurations in Kuramoto models is a
    ubiquitous mathematical problem that has found applications in many seemingly
    independent fields. In this paper, we focus on networks whose underlying graph
    are cycle graphs. Based on the recent result on the upper bound of the
    frequency synchronization configurations in this context, we propose a toric
    deformation homotopy method for locating all frequency synchronization
    configurations with complexity that is linear in this upper bound. Loosely
    based on the polyhedral homotopy method, this homotopy induces a deformation of
    the set of the synchronization configurations into a series of toric varieties,
    yet our method has the distinct advantage of avoiding the costly step of
    computing mixed cells. We also explore the important consequences of this
    homotopy method in the context of direct acyclic decomposition of Kuramoto
    networks and tropical stable intersection points for Kuramoto equations.

  title: An index-resolved fixed-point homotopy and potential energy landscapes
  coauthors: Dhagash Mehta
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06622
  abstract: >
    Stationary points (SPs) of the potential energy landscapes can be classified
    by their Morse index, i.e., the number of negative eigenvalues of the
    Hessian evaluated at the SPs.
    In understanding chemical clusters through their potential energy landscapes,
    only SPs of a particular Morse index are needed.
    We propose a modification of the "fixed-point homotopy" method which can be
    used to directly target stationary points of a specified Morse index.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the
    Lennard-Jones clusters.

    The Kuramoto model is a classical model used in the study of
    spontaneous synchronizations in networks of coupled oscillators.
    In this model, frequency synchronization configurations can be formulated
    as complex solutions to a system of algebraic equations.
    Recently, upper bounds to the number of frequency synchronization configurations 
    in cycle networks of N oscillators  were calculated 
    under the assumption of generic non-uniform coupling.
    In this paper, we refine these results for the special cases of uniform coupling.
    In particular, we show that when, and only when, N is divisible by 4,
    the upper bound for the number of synchronization configurations
    in the uniform coupling cases is significantly less than 
    the bound in the non-uniform coupling cases.
    This result also establishes an explicit formula for the gap between
    the birationally invariant intersection index and the 
    Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii bound
    for the underlying algebraic equations.

  title: Graph edge contraction and adjacency polytopes

  abstract: >
    Adjacency polytopes, a.k.a. symmetric edge polytopes, associated with undirected graphs 
    have been proposed and studied in several seemingly independent areas ranging from 
    number theory to discrete geometry and the study of Kuramoto models. 
    Regular subdivisions of adjacency polytopes are of particular importance in 
    solving certain algebraic systems of equations. 
    This paper explores the connection between the regular subdivisions of an adjacency polytope 
    and the contraction of the underlying graph along an edge. 
    The main result is the construction of a special regular subdivision 
    whose cells are in one-to-one correspondence with facets of adjacency polytope 
    associated with an edge-contraction of the original graph.

  title: On the equality of BKK bound and birationally invariant intersection index

  abstract: > 
    The Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii theorem provides a generic root count
    for system of Laurent polynomials in terms of the mixed volume of their Newton polytopes
    which has since been known as the BKK bound.
    A recent and far-reaching generalization of this theorem is the study of
    birationally invariant intersection index by Kaveh and Khovanskii.
    In this paper we generalize the BKK bound
    in the direction of the birationally invariant intersection index,
    and the main result allows the application of BKK bound to 
    Laurent polynomial systems that has algebraic relations among the coefficients.
    Applying this result, we establish the birationally invariant intersection index
    for a well-studied algebraic Kuramoto equations.

  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07716
  abstract: >
    By using the viewpoint of modern computational algebraic geometry,
    we explore properties of the optimization landscapes of the deep linear neural network models. 
    After clarifying on the various definitions of "flat" minima, we show that the geometrically flat minima, 
    which are merely artifacts of residual continuous symmetries of the deep linear networks, 
    can be straightforwardly removed by a generalized $L_2$ regularization. 
    Then, we establish upper bounds on the number of isolated stationary 
    points of these networks with the help of algebraic geometry. 
    Using these upper bounds and utilizing a numerical algebraic geometry method, 
    we find all stationary points for modest depth and matrix size. 
    We show that in the presence of the non-zero regularization, 
    deep linear networks indeed possess local minima which are not the global minima. 
    Our computational results further clarify certain aspects of the loss surfaces of deep linear networks and provides novel insights.

  abstract: >
    The study of frequency synchronization configurations in Kuramoto models is a
    ubiquitous mathematical problem that has found applications in many seemingly
    independent fields. In this paper, we focus on networks whose underlying graph
    are cycle graphs. Based on the recent result on the upper bound of the
    frequency synchronization configurations in this context, we propose a toric
    deformation homotopy method for locating all frequency synchronization
    configurations with complexity that is linear in this upper bound. Loosely
    based on the polyhedral homotopy method, this homotopy induces a deformation of
    the set of the synchronization configurations into a series of toric varieties,
    yet our method has the distinct advantage of avoiding the costly step of
    computing mixed cells. We also explore the important consequences of this
    homotopy method in the context of direct acyclic decomposition of Kuramoto
    networks and tropical stable intersection points for Kuramoto equations.

  title: An index-resolved fixed-point homotopy and potential energy landscapes
  coauthors: Dhagash Mehta
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06622
  abstract: >
    Stationary points (SPs) of the potential energy landscapes can be classified
    by their Morse index, i.e., the number of negative eigenvalues of the
    Hessian evaluated at the SPs.
    In understanding chemical clusters through their potential energy landscapes,
    only SPs of a particular Morse index are needed.
    We propose a modification of the "fixed-point homotopy" method which can be
    used to directly target stationary points of a specified Morse index.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the
    Lennard-Jones clusters.

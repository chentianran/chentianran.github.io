  abstract: > 
    The Kuramoto model is a dynamical system that models the interaction of coupled oscillators.
    There has been much work to effectively bound the number of equilibria to
    the Kuramoto model for a given network.
    By formulating the Kuramoto equations as a system of algebraic equations,
    we first relate the complex root count of the Kuramoto equations to the
    combinatorics of the underlying network by showing that the complex root count
    is generically equal to the normalized volume of the corresponding adjacency polytope of the network.
    We then give explicit algebraic conditions under which this bound is strict and show that there are conditions
    where the Kuramoto equations have infinitely many equilibria.

  title: (Short note) Volume of convex polytopes equals mixed volume of simplices
  pdf: v-is-mv.pdf
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12875
  abstract: >
    This note provides a simple proof for the equality between the normalized
    volume of a convex polytope with $m$ vertices and the mixed volume of $m$
    simplices and thus shows the seemingly restrictive problem of computing mixed
    volume of simplices is still at least as hard as computing volumes of convex polytopes.

  title: Facets and facet subgraphs of adjacency polytopes

  arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12315
  abstract: >
    Adjacency polytopes, a.k.a. symmetric edge polytopes,
    associated with undirected graphs have been defined and studied
    in several seemingly-independent areas including
    number theory, discrete geometry, and dynamical systems.
    In particular, the authors are motivated by the study of
    the algebraic Kuramoto equations of unmixed form
    whose Newton polytopes are the adjacency polytopes.

    The interplay between the geometric structure of adjacency polytopes
    and the topological structure of the underlying graphs is a recurring theme
    in recent studies.
    In particular, "facet/face subgraphs" emerged as one of the central concepts
    in describing this symmetry.
    Continuing along this line of inquiry we provide a complete description of
    the correspondence between facets/faces of an adjacency polytope
    and maximal bipartite subgraphs of the underlying connected graph.

  title: On the root count of algebraic Kuramoto equations in cycle networks with uniform coupling

  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06241
  abstract: >
    The Kuramoto model is a classical model used in the study of
    spontaneous synchronizations in networks of coupled oscillators.
    In this model, frequency synchronization configurations can be formulated
    as complex solutions to a system of algebraic equations.
    Recently, upper bounds to the number of frequency synchronization configurations 
    in cycle networks of N oscillators  were calculated 
    under the assumption of generic non-uniform coupling.
    In this paper, we refine these results for the special cases of uniform coupling.
    In particular, we show that when, and only when, N is divisible by 4,
    the upper bound for the number of synchronization configurations
    in the uniform coupling cases is significantly less than 
    the bound in the non-uniform coupling cases.
    This result also establishes an explicit formula for the gap between
    the birationally invariant intersection index and the 
    Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii bound
    for the underlying algebraic equations.

  arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02841
  abstract: >
    Adjacency polytopes, a.k.a. symmetric edge polytopes, associated with undirected graphs 
    have been proposed and studied in several seemingly independent areas ranging from 
    number theory to discrete geometry and the study of Kuramoto models. 
    Regular subdivisions of adjacency polytopes are of particular importance in 
    solving certain algebraic systems of equations. 
    This paper explores the connection between the regular subdivisions of an adjacency polytope 
    and the contraction of the underlying graph along an edge. 
    The main result is the construction of a special regular subdivision 
    whose cells are in one-to-one correspondence with facets of adjacency polytope 
    associated with an edge-contraction of the original graph.

  title: On the equality of BKK bound and birationally invariant intersection index
  pdf: bkk-biii.pdf
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05408
  abstract: > 
    The Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii theorem provides a generic root count
    for system of Laurent polynomials in terms of the mixed volume of their Newton polytopes
    which has since been known as the BKK bound.
    A recent and far-reaching generalization of this theorem is the study of
    birationally invariant intersection index by Kaveh and Khovanskii.
    In this paper we generalize the BKK bound
    in the direction of the birationally invariant intersection index,
    and the main result allows the application of BKK bound to 
    Laurent polynomial systems that has algebraic relations among the coefficients.
    Applying this result, we establish the birationally invariant intersection index
    for a well-studied algebraic Kuramoto equations.

- nickname: index-resolved
  title: An index-resolved fixed-point homotopy and potential energy landscapes
  coauthors: Dhagash Mehta
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06622
  abstract: >
    Stationary points (SPs) of the potential energy landscapes can be classified
    by their Morse index, i.e., the number of negative eigenvalues of the
    Hessian evaluated at the SPs.
    In understanding chemical clusters through their potential energy landscapes,
    only SPs of a particular Morse index are needed.
    We propose a modification of the "fixed-point homotopy" method which can be
    used to directly target stationary points of a specified Morse index.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the
    Lennard-Jones clusters.

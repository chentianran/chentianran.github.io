  abstract: >
    The free sum is a basic geometric operation among convex polytopes.
    This note focuses on the relationship between the normalized volume
    of the free sum and that of the summands.
    In particular, we show that the normalized volume of the free sum
    of full dimensional polytopes is precisely the product of the
    normalized volumes of the summands.

  abstract: >
    The free sum is a basic geometric operation among convex polytopes.
    This note focuses on the relationship between the normalized volume
    of the free sum and that of the summands.
    In particular, we show that the normalized volume of the free sum
    of full dimensional polytopes is precisely the product of the
    normalized volumes of the summands.

    Counting equilibria of the Kuramoto model using
    birationally invariant intersection index

  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09246
  abstract: >
    Synchronization in networks of interconnected oscillators is a
    fascinating phenomenon that appear naturally in many independent fields
    of science and engineering.
    A substantial amount of work has been devoted to understanding
    all possible synchronization configurations on a given network.
    In this setting, a key problem is to determine the total number of
    such configurations.
    Through an algebraic formulation, for tree and cycle graphs,
    we provide an upper bound on this number using the
    birationally invariant intersection index of a
    system of rational functions on a toric variety.

  title: Unmixing the mixed volume computation
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01684
  abstract: >
    Computing mixed volume of convex polytopes is an important problem
    in computational algebraic geometry.
    This paper establishes sufficient conditions under which the mixed volume
    of several convex polytopes exactly equals the normalized volume of the
    convex hull of their union.
    Under these conditions the problem of computing mixed volume of
    several polytopes can be transformed into a volume computation problem
    for a single polytope in the same dimension.
    We demonstrate through problems from real world applications that
    substantial reduction in computational costs can be achieved via
    this transformation in situations where the convex hull of the union
    of the polytopes has less complex geometry than the original polytopes.
    We also discuss the important implications of this result in the
    polyhedral homotopy method for solving polynomial systems.

    Counting equilibria of the Kuramoto model using

  abstract: >
    Synchronization in networks of interconnected oscillators is a
    fascinating phenomenon that appear naturally in many independent fields
    of science and engineering.
    A substantial amount of work has been devoted to understanding
    all possible synchronization configurations on a given network.
    In this setting, a key problem is to determine the total number of
    such configurations.
    Through an algebraic formulation, for tree and cycle graphs,
    we provide an upper bound on this number using the
    birationally invariant intersection index of a
    system of rational functions on a toric variety.

  title: Unmixing the mixed volume computation
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01684
  abstract: >
    Computing mixed volume of convex polytopes is an important problem
    in computational algebraic geometry.
    This paper establishes sufficient conditions under which the mixed volume
    of several convex polytopes exactly equals the normalized volume of the
    convex hull of their union.
    Under these conditions the problem of computing mixed volume of
    several polytopes can be transformed into a volume computation problem
    for a single polytope in the same dimension.
    We demonstrate through problems from real world applications that
    substantial reduction in computational costs can be achieved via
    this transformation in situations where the convex hull of the union
    of the polytopes has less complex geometry than the original polytopes.
    We also discuss the important implications of this result in the
    polyhedral homotopy method for solving polynomial systems.

    A network topology dependent upper bound
    on the number of equilibria of the Kuramoto model
  coauthors: Dhagash Mehta and Matthew Niemerg
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04987
  abstract: >
    We begin with formulating the stationary equations of the Kuramoto model
    as a system of polynomial equations in a novel way.
    Then, based on an algebraic geometric root count, we give a prescription
    of computing an upper bound on the number of equilibria of the
    Kuramoto model for the most general case, i.e., defined on an
    arbitrary graph and having generic values of natural frequencies
    and inhomogeneous couplings.
    We demonstrate with computational experiments utilizing the
    numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method that
    our bound is tight for the number of complex equilibria
    for the Kuramoto model in the most general case.
    We then discuss the implications or our results in relation to
    finding all the real equilibria of the Kuramoto model.

  title: An index-resolved fixed-point homotopy and potential energy landscapes
  coauthors: Dhagash Mehta
  arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06622
  abstract: >
    Stationary points (SPs) of the potential energy landscapes can be classified
    by their Morse index, i.e., the number of negative eigenvalues of the
    Hessian evaluated at the SPs.
    In understanding chemical clusters through their potential energy landscapes,
    only SPs of a particular Morse index are needed.
    We propose a modification of the "fixed-point homotopy" method which can be
    used to directly target stationary points of a specified Morse index.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the
    Lennard-Jones clusters.

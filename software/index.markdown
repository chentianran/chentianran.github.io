Software
========

-   [Hom4PS-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org) is a parallel numerical solver for polynomial systems 
    developed based on the *polyhedral homotopy continuation method*.

-   [MixedVol-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org) is a software package for computing mixed volume 
    and mixed cells of polytopes in any dimension. It is now an integral part of Hom4PS-3,
    but I plan to make it an independent software program.

-   Skywalker (under active development) is a parallel program for finding real solutions 
    to nonlinear systems of equations that implements *Newton homotopy*, *fixed point homotopy*, 
    *d-homotopy*, and many other real homotopy constructions.
    It is used in my collaborative work with Dhagash Mehta, Jonathan Hauenstein, and David Wales
    that studies the configuration of chemical clusters.

-   Akimbo (under active development) in an OpenCL-based library for evaluating multi-variate 
    systems of polynomials together with their Jacobian matrices on GPU.

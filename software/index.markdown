Software
========


-   [Hom4PS-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org) is a parallel numerical solver for polynomial systems
    developed based on the *polyhedral homotopy continuation method*.

-   [__libtropicana__](https://github.com/chentianran/libtropicana):
    A library designed to find regular simplicial subdivision of lattice convex polytopes and also compute normalized volume as a byproduct. It is written completely in C++ with optional interface for leveraging spBLAS (Sparse BLAS) routines. It is open source software. Users may freely distribute its source under the terms of the LGPLv3 license.

-   [MixedVol-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org) is a software package for computing mixed volume
    and mixed cells of polytopes in any dimension. It is now an integral part of Hom4PS-3,
    but I plan to make it an independent software program.

-   Skywalker (under active development) is a parallel program for finding real solutions
    to nonlinear systems of equations that implements *Newton homotopy*, *fixed point homotopy*,
    *d-homotopy*, and many other real homotopy constructions.
    It is used in my collaborative work with Dhagash Mehta, Jonathan Hauenstein, and David Wales
    that studies the configuration of chemical clusters.

-   Akimbo (under active development) in an OpenCL-based library for evaluating multi-variate
    systems of polynomials together with their Jacobian matrices on GPU.

Hi, I am Tianran Chen
=====================

I am a research instructor at Michigan State University. 
My current research focuses on numerical solutions to nonlinear system of equations 
and other aspects of numerical algebraic geometry. 
In particular, my recent works revolve around the polyhedral homotopy continuation method for solving polynomial systems.

I am involved in the creation and development of a few software packages for numerical computation:

* Hom4PS-2.0: A numerical solver for polynomial systems based on polyhedral homotopy continuation method
* [Hom4PS-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org): A parallel numerical solver for polynomial systems based on polyhedral homotopy continuation method
* MixedVol-3
* Skywalker
* Akimbo

Hi, I am Tianran Chen
=====================

I am an Associate Professor at [Auburn University at Montgomery](http://www.aum.edu)
in the Department of Mathematics
(Distinguished Research Associate Professor of Mathematics).
I studied under the guidance of [Tien-Yien Li](https://sites.google.com/view/tienyienli)
and received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Michigan State University.

My main research interests are numerical analysis and scientific computing
as well as their applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.
My current research focuses on _numerical algebraic geometry_
with applications in power flow studies
and is supported by the National Science Foundation through
award DMS-2318837.
You can find out more about [my research here](research/).
For more information, please see [my CV here](cv/) ([PDF version](cv.pdf)).

In the Fall semester of 2024 I am teaching

News and recent talks
---------------------

- Recently, I gave a talk titled
  _Polynomials in economics and polyhedral homotopy_
  in the workshop
  [Invitation to Algebraic Statistics and Applications](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/invitation-to-algebraic-statistics-and-applications/)
  which is a part of the long program on
  [Algebraic Statistics and Our Changing World](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/algebraic-statistics-and-our-changing-world/)
  hosted by _Institute of Mathematical and Statistical Innovation_
  at the University of Chicago  
  September 21, 2023  
  University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.  
  [ [talk slides](/talks/IMSI2023/) ]

- I gave a talk titled
  _Stratified polyhedral homotopy_
  in the
  [AMS Special Session on Polynomial Systems, Homotopy Continuation and Applications](https://www.jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2023/2270_program_ss95.html)
  during the _Joint Mathematics Meetings_  
  January 4, 2023  
  Boston, MA, USA.

Scientific Software
-------------------

- [__libtropicon__](/tropicon/)
    A library for computing intersection points of generic tropical hypersurfaces.
- [__Hom4PS-3__](http://www.hom4ps3.org):
    A parallel numerical solver for systems of polynomial equations based on the Polyhedral Homotopy Method.
- __MixedVol-3__:
    A parallel software package for computing mixed volume, BKK bound,
    and fine mixed subdivisions (now a part of [Hom4PS-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org)).
- [__libtropicana__](https://github.com/chentianran/libtropicana):
    A library designed to find regular simplicial subdivision of lattice convex polytopes and also compute normalized volume as a byproduct. It is written completely in C++ with optional interface for leveraging spBLAS (Sparse BLAS) routines. It is open source software. Users may freely distribute its source under the terms of the LGPLv3 license.

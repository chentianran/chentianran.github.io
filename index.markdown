Hi, I am Tianran Chen
=====================

I am a research instructor at Michigan State University. 
My research interests span a wide range of subjects in numerical analysis
and scientific computation as well as their applications in science and engineering.
My current research focuses on numerical solutions to nonlinear system of equations 
and other aspects of numerical algebraic geometry. 
In particular, my recent works revolve around the *polyhedral homotopy continuation method* 
for solving polynomial systems.

I am among the core developers of several software packages/programs for numerical computation:
[Hom4PS-2.0](http://www.math.nsysu.edu.tw/~leetsung/works/HOM4PS_soft.htm),
[Hom4PS-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org)
MixedVol-3, and the binomial system solver module inside Hom4PS-3.

My detailed CV is [here](cv.pdf).

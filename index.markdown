Hi, I am Tianran Chen
=====================

I am a research instructor at Michigan State University. 
My current research focuses on numerical solutions to nonlinear system of equations 
and other aspects of numerical algebraic geometry. 
In particular, my recent works revolve around the polyhedral homotopy continuation method for solving polynomial systems.

This semester I teach MTH-299, a course focus on mathematical proofs. 
Please visit my [teaching page](/teaching/) for more information.

I am involved in the creation and development of a few software packages for numerical computation:

* Hom4PS-2.0: A numerical solver for polynomial systems based on polyhedral homotopy continuation method
* [Hom4PS-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org): A parallel numerical solver for polynomial systems based on polyhedral homotopy continuation method
* MixedVol-3: A software package for computing mixed volume and mixed cells of polytopes in any dimension (now a part of Hom4PS-3)
* Skywalker: A program for finding real solutions to nonlinear systems of equations implementing Newton homotopy, fixed point homotopy, and _d_-homotopy
* Akimbo: An OpenCL-based library for evaluating multi-variate systems of polynomials together with their Jacobian matrices on GPU

Hi, I am Tianran Chen
=====================

I am an Associate Professor at [Auburn University at Montgomery](http://www.aum.edu)
in the Department of Mathematics
(Distinguished Research Associate Professor of Mathematics).
I studied under the guidance of [Tien-Yien Li](https://sites.google.com/view/tienyienli)
and received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Michigan State University.

My main research interests are numerical analysis and scientific computing
as well as their applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.
My current research focuses on _numerical algebraic geometry_
and is supported by [NSF grant DMS-1923099](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1923099).
You can find out more about [my research here](research/).
For more information, please see [my CV here](cv/) ([PDF version](cv.pdf)).

In the Spring semester of 2023 I am teaching

- [ENGR-1210](teaching/matlab/)    (Introduction to computer programming)
- [MATH-1610](teaching/calc1/)     (Calculus I),
- [MATH-3660](teaching/applinalg/) (Applied linear algebra)

Scientific Software
-------------------

- [__libtropicon__](/tropicon/)
    A library for computing intersection points of generic tropical hypersurfaces.
- [__Hom4PS-3__](http://www.hom4ps3.org):
    A parallel numerical solver for systems of polynomial equations based on the Polyhedral Homotopy Method.
- __MixedVol-3__:
    A parallel software package for computing mixed volume, BKK bound,
    and fine mixed subdivisions (now a part of [Hom4PS-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org)).
- [__libtropicana__](https://github.com/chentianran/libtropicana):
    A library designed to find regular simplicial subdivision of lattice convex polytopes and also compute normalized volume as a byproduct. It is written completely in C++ with optional interface for leveraging spBLAS (Sparse BLAS) routines. It is open source software. Users may freely distribute its source under the terms of the LGPLv3 license.

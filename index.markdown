Hi, I am Tianran Chen
=====================

I am an Associate Professor at [Auburn University at Montgomery](http://www.aum.edu)
in the Department of Mathematics
(Distinguished Research Associate Professor of Mathematics).
I studied under the guidance of [Tien-Yien Li](https://sites.google.com/view/tienyienli)
and received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Michigan State University.

My main research interests are numerical analysis and scientific computing
as well as their applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.
My recent research focuses on _numerical algebraic geometry_
and is supported by
[NSF grant DMS-1923099](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1923099).
You can find out more about [my research here](research/).
For more information, please see [my CV here](cv/) ([PDF version](cv.pdf)).

In the Fall of 2023 I am teaching

- [MATH-1610](teaching/calc1/)     (Calculus I),
- [MATH-2630](teaching/calc3/)     (Multivariable Calculus)
- [MATH-4400](teaching/modsim/)    (Math Models and Simulations)

News and recent talks
---------------------

- Recently, I gave a talk titled
  _Polynomials in economics and polyhedral homotopy_
  in the workshop
  [Invitation to Algebraic Statistics and Applications](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/invitation-to-algebraic-statistics-and-applications/)
  which is a part of the long program on

- I gave a talk titled
  _Stratified polyhedral homotopy_
  in the
  [AMS Special Session on Polynomial Systems, Homotopy Continuation and Applications](https://www.jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2023/2270_program_ss95.html)

Scientific Software
-------------------

- [__libtropicon__](/tropicon/)
    A library for computing intersection points of generic tropical hypersurfaces.
- [__Hom4PS-3__](http://www.hom4ps3.org):
    A parallel numerical solver for systems of polynomial equations based on the Polyhedral Homotopy Method.
- __MixedVol-3__:
    A parallel software package for computing mixed volume, BKK bound,
    and fine mixed subdivisions (now a part of [Hom4PS-3](http://www.hom4ps3.org)).
- [__libtropicana__](https://github.com/chentianran/libtropicana):
    A library designed to find regular simplicial subdivision of lattice convex polytopes and also compute normalized volume as a byproduct. It is written completely in C++ with optional interface for leveraging spBLAS (Sparse BLAS) routines. It is open source software. Users may freely distribute its source under the terms of the LGPLv3 license.

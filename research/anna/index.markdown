# The ANNA group
The ANNA (Applied and Numerical Nonlinear Algebra) group is
an informal research group that specializes in conducting research in applied mathematics,
utilizing tools from nonlinear algebra.
The ANNA group is constantly seeking out students who can help them push the boundaries of what is possible in this field.
That's why we hire student research assistants to work on various projects.

As a student research assistant with the ANNA group,
you will have the opportunity to gain valuable hands-on experience
in the field of applied and computational mathematics.
You will be tasked with conducting research, analyzing data, and
contributing your own ideas to ongoing projects.
This is a fantastic opportunity to gain real-world experience and build your skills.

The ANNA group provides a supportive and collaborative environment that
fosters students' learning and growth.
We are committed to providing their student research assistants with
the resources and support they need to succeed,
including access to cutting-edge technology, training and development opportunities, and mentorship from experienced researchers.

If you are passionate about mathematics and are looking for an opportunity
to gain valuable research experience,
the ANNA group could be the perfect fit for you.

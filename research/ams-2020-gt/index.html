    <h3>Different buses</h3>
    <p class="fragment">
        We can model an AC power network as graph $G$
        whose vertices represent "buses"
        and   edges    represent junctions.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Three basic types of buses

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">
            <span class="alert">PV-buses</span>
            are generator buses.

            <span class="alert">PQ-buses</span>
            are load buses.

            <span class="alert">Reference buses</span>
            provide references relative to which
            all other buses are measured.

    </ul>
    <p class="fragment">
        PV and PQ buses result in very different formulations.

    <h3>Lossless PQ-type formulation</h3>
    <p>
        Here we only focus on a much simplified formulation in which 
        <b>all non-reference buses are modeled as PQ buses</b>,
        and no electric energy is lost in the network.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">These assumptions are not realistic.</li>
        <li class="fragment">
            Such formulations are studied in engineering context.
        </li>
        <li class="fragment">
            More realistic formulations involve a mixture of PV and PQ 
            (and reference) buses as well as power loss.
        </li>
        <li class="fragment">
            Realistic formulation can be obtained from this formulation
            by removing equations and adding constraints.

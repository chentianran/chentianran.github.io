What is mixed volume
====================

The short answer is: _I honestly do not know_.

Minkowski sums of convex bodies
-------------------------------

The Minkowski sum of a curve and a two dimensional shape is fairly easy
to understand in an intuitive sense.


Mixed volume: the general definition
------------------------------------

Given \\(n\\) convex bodies (nonempty convex sets) in \\(A_1,\ldots,A_n\\) in \\(R^n\\),
we consider their scaled versions \\(\lambda_1 A_1, \ldots, \lambda_n A_n\\) by positive
scaling factors \\(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n\\).
<div>
\[
    \text{vol}(A_1,A_2)
\]
</div>


Trivial case: volume
--------------------


Simple case: mixed area
-----------------------
It is perhaps best to start with the simplest case: the mixed area.

My current research focuses on numerical solutions to systems of polynomial equations
and the more general field of numerical algebraic geometry.

Mixed volume and mixed cells
============================

Originally developed in the context of convex geometry, _mixed volume_ is a way
to assign a generalized non-negative volume to a list of convex bodies.
It depends on not only the volume of each individual convex body, but also
their relative positions.
This concept has a wide range of applications in geometry and combinatorics. 
In the recent decades, it has found important applications in the study of 
system of polynomial equations (i.e. algebraic geometry):
by the Bershtein's theorem, the number of isolated solutions a system of
polynomial equations has, counting multiplicity, is bounded by
the mixed volume of Newton polytopes of the system.
This bound is usually much tighter than another well studied bound, the Bezout number.

* MixedVol-3 a parallel software package for computing mixed cells


Homotopy continuation methods
=============================

Homotopy continuation methods form a large class of general methods
suitable for solving hard problems like nonlinear systems of equations,
in particular, systems of polynomial equations.
The basic idea behind such methods is to deform a hard problem in to
an easier problem or into a problem whose solutions are already known,
and use the solutions of the easier problem to find those of the harder problem.

* Real homotopy continuation methods
* Framework for homotopy continuation methods over the complex numbers
* Polyhedral homotopy 


Binomial systems
================

A binomial is a polynomial having exactly two terms.

A system of binomial equations (or simply binomial systems) can be solved easily
regardless the degree and the number of variables.

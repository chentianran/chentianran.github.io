# Minisymposium on Algorithms and Implementation in Numerical Algebraic Geometry

### When and where
* Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta GA, USA)
* July 31 to August 4 2017

### Overview
The foundation of algebraic geometry is the problem of solving systems of
polynomial equations.
Numerical methods can be used to perform algebraic geometric computations forming
the field of numerical algebraic geometry which continues to advance rapidly.
The continuing progress in computer hardware and software has enabled new algorithms and implementations.
Examples include irreducible decompositions in multi-projective spaces,
and numerical techniques for computing discrete objects such as polytopes.
This session will feature recent progress in algorithms and implementations
of theoretical advances in numerical algebraic geometry.

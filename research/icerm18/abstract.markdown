# BKK bound and polyhedral homotopy

BKK bound and polyhedral homotopy are two important tools for
counting and finding all solutions to systems of polynomial equations.
This talk provides a brief overview of the theory and algorithms
behind these two ideas from the viewpoint of
tropical intersection theory.
We will also explore the challenges in applying these tools
to new problems.

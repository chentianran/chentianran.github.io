  abstract = {The comment notes that the Newton homotopy (NH) and Newton trajectory (NT) methods are related. By describing recent implementations of the NH method, we clarify the similarities and differences between the two approaches. The possible synergy between NH, NT and other flow methods could suggest further developments in mathematics and chemistry.},

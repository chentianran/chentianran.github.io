In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged

* Chapter 7: Linear system of equations 
* Chapter 8: Matrices

### Textbook

_Precalculus_ (9th edition) by Ron Larson

Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from the textbook.

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part 
of the learning process. 
Therefore class attendance is expected and recorded.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom 
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Cheating policy

Cheating of any kind will not be tolerated.
In particular, you cannot copy (totally or partially) someone else's solutions
or allow someone else to copy your solutions on quizzes or exams.
You will receive an "F" in the course if you are caught.
Please consult Student Handbook for addition guidelines.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems. 
According to AUM Mathematics Department Calculator Policy,
students are required to have a graphing calculator
(TI-84 is recommended).
The use of such calculators may be required for certain homework problems
or in-class activities.
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore calculators or any smart devices with internet capabilities 
are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

### Quizzes

There will be a short quiz each week.
No makeup quiz will be offered.
However, a missing quiz may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of zero.

In computing the final scores, _two of the lowest_ quiz scores 
(that are not missed) will be dropped.

### Exams

Two in-class exams constitute an important part of your course grade.
No makeup exams will be offered,
but a missing exam may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing exam receives a score of zero.

The mandatory final exam is scheduled 1:30pm--4:00pm Dec. 6 2016.
It constitutes a major part of your course grade.

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of quizzes, 
the in-class exams, and the final exam, and is calculated according to the 
following weights.

| Component  | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| Quizzes    | 40%    | 
| Exam 1     | 20%    |
| Exam 2     | 20%    |
| Final Exam | 20%    |

### Grading scale 

* A: 90% - 100% 
* B: 80% - 89% 
* C: 65% - 79% 
* D: 55% - 64% 
* F: 54 or below 

Borderline grades are determined by in-class participation 
(in discussions and activities) as well as attendance.

### Suggested homework problems

Practice is a crucial component in the learning process.
Certain exercise problems will be assigned in class.
They will not be collected or graded. 
However, since all exams are very similar to questions from homework, 
doing the homework problems regularly is crucial for our success in this course.

## University policies

# Alternating harmonic series

The alternating harmonic series is a modification on the harmonic series
in which the terms have alternating signs (+ - + - + ...).
We write it as $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \frac{1}{n}$$
where the power of $$(-1)$$ is used to express the alternating sign.
The demo below shows how the partial sum $$S$$ grows as $$n \to \infty$$.
Can you tell if it converges to a number?
And what will that number be?

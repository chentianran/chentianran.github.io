{% include hours.markdown %}

My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

This is the first course in the calculus sequence.
We will focus on basic calculus concepts involving functions of one variable:
limits, derivatives, and integrals.
In this course, conceptual understanding is paramount,
and mathematical rigor will be kept to the minimum.

### Prerequisite

In order to succeed in this class, certain basic mathematical skills are necessary.
In particular, we need to feel comfortable manipulating algebraic expressions
and functions (including trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions).
These prerequisite can be satisfied by any one of the following:

* MATH-1120 (Precalculus algebra) _and_ MATH-1550 (Trigonometry)
* MATH-1150 (Precalculus algebra with trigonometry)
* An ACT Math score of 25 or higher (620 on SAT)
* An appropriate score in the AUM Math Placement Test.

### Textbook

- [Required] _Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (any edition) by Larson & Edwards
  (8th edition ISBN: 978-1285741550)
- [Optional] _Calculus_ by Gilbert Strang (PDF version is _free_!)
    * [One single big PDF file](http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/Strang/Edited/Calculus/Calculus.pdf)
    * [PDF files by chapters](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/)
    * [A few greate video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/highlights_of_calculus/big-picture-of-calculus/)

Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from the required textbook.

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected and recorded.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
According to AUM Mathematics Department Calculator Policy,
students are required to have a graphing calculator
(TI-84 is recommended).
The use of such calculators may be required for certain homework problems
or in-class activities.
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore calculators or any smart devices with internet capabilities
are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

### Homework

Practice is an important part of learning process.
Homework problem will be assigned every week.

### Daily quizzes

There will be a short quiz at the beginning of __every__ class meeting
to test our understanding of the material discussed in the previous meetings.
Since the solutions will be released on the same day,
__no makeup quiz will be offered__.
However, a missing quiz may be excused if valid reasons
(official university events, illness or medical emergencies,
death of immediate family, military orders, jury duty,
religious holidays, or extreme weather conditions)
and _proper documentation_ are provided (preferably _in advance_).
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of _zero_.

### Final exam

The mandatory final exam is scheduled at 1:30pm--3:00pm May 3rd 2017.
It constitutes a major part of your course grade.
The final exam consists of two parts:

- The _core part_ tests basic understanding of fundamental concepts.
  In order to earn a passing grade (D or higher) one must achieve
  80% or higher on this part.
- The _other part_ is just the regular type of comprehensive exam.

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of
homework, projects, quizzes, and the final exam,
and is calculated according to the following weights:

| Component  | Points |
|------------|--------|
| Homework   |   80   |
| Projects   |   80   |
| Quizzes    |  540   |
| Final Exam |  100   |

### Grading scale

* A: 90% - 100%
* B: 80% - 89.9%
* C: 70% - 79.9%
* D: 60% - 69.9%
* F: below 60% or fail to achieve 80% on the "core" part of the final exam

Borderline grades are determined by in-class participation
(in discussions and activities) as well as attendance.

### Suggested homework problems

Practice is a crucial component in the learning process.
The following is a list of good exercise problems.
They will not be collected or graded.
However, since all exams are very similar to questions from homework,
doing the homework problems regularly is crucial for our success in this course.

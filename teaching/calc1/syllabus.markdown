My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

This is the first course in the calculus sequence.
We will focus on basic calculus concepts involving functions of one variable:
limits, derivatives, and integrals.
In this course, conceptual understanding is paramount,
and mathematical rigor will be kept to the minimum.

### Prerequisite

In order to succeed in this class, certain basic mathematical skills are necessary.
In particular, we need to feel comfortable manipulating algebraic expressions
and functions (including trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions).
These prerequisite can be satisfied by any one of the following:

* MATH-1120 (Precalculus algebra) _and_ MATH-1550 (Trigonometry)
* MATH-1150 (Precalculus algebra with trigonometry)
* An ACT Math score of 25 or higher (620 on SAT)
* An appropriate score in the AUM Math Placement Test.

### Textbook

- _Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (7th edition) by Larson & Edwards
  ISBN: 9781337552516
- Supplement:
  [OpenSTAX Calculus Volume 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1)

<!-- Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from these textbook. -->
<!-- (Either one is fine) -->

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected and recorded.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ play video games
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
According to AUM Mathematics Department Calculator Policy,
students are required to have a graphing calculator
(TI-84 is recommended).
The use of such calculators may be required for certain homework problems.
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore, calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities
are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

### Reading tests

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
__Late submission will receive lower scores__.
However, a missing reading test may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish the reading test at least a few days
before the due date.

Each reading test allows multiple attempts.
Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail.

### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
All concepts tests are due on the last day of classes,
and __Late submission will receive lower scores__.
However, it is strongly recommended that you complete them as early as possible.

### In-class and online quizzes

Short in-class quizzes are designed
to test our understanding of the material discussed in the previous weeks.
Slightly longer online quizzes (via Blackboard system) serve a similar purpose.
These quizzes will be a major part of your course grade.
Since the solutions will be released on the same day,
__no makeup quiz will be offered__.
However, a missing quiz may be replaced by an online quiz
(official university events, illness or medical emergencies,
death of immediate family, military orders, jury duty,
religious holidays, or extreme weather conditions)
and _proper documentation_ are provided (preferably _in advance_).
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of _zero_.

### Homework

Practice in problem-solving is an important part of this course.
Problems will be assigned on the _Blackboard system_.
These problems will be graded and will be a major component
in your course grade.

<!-- ### Worksheets

Worksheet problems will also be assigned in class.
Since these must be completed in class,
__no makeup worksheets will be offered__.
However, a missing worksheet may be excused if valid reasons
(official university events, illness or medical emergencies,
death of immediate family, military orders, jury duty,
religious holidays, or extreme weather conditions)
and _proper documentation_ are provided (preferably _in advance_).
Otherwise, a missing worksheet receives a score of _zero_. -->

### Final exam

Final exam, designed to test your overall understanding of the core concepts,
will take place on __April 27__ at __10:45 AM__.

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of
homework, projects, quizzes, and the final exam,
and is calculated according to the following weights:

| Component        | Points | Where               |
|------------------|--------|---------------------|
| Reading tests    |  15%   | Blackboard          |
| Homework         |  15%   | Blackboard          |
| Concept tests    |  15%   | Blackboard          |
| Quizzes          |  45%   | In-class/Blackboard |
| Final            |  10%   | In-class            |

### Grading scale

* A: 90% - 100%
* B: 80% - 89.9%
* C: 70% - 79.9%
* D: 60% - 69.9%
* F: below 60%

Border line grades are determined by in-class participation
(in-class discussions and activities) as well as attendance.

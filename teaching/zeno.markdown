title: Zeno's arrow paradox

# {{ page.title }}

Zenoâ€™s Arrow Paradox is a philosophical argument about motion.
Indeed, it argues that motion is impossible.
Imagine an arrow fly through air.
Zeno argues that time is composed of moments and a moving arrow must occupy
a space "equal to itself during any moment".
Basically, at any indivisible moment (or instant) it is at the place where it is.
(Duh!)
But of course "places" themselves cannot move.
So, the arrow is not moving in that moment.
Here the main argument is that motion requires time (which sounds reasonable)
Of course the same reasoning holds for any other moment.
So we must conclude that, the arrow is never moving.

To translate to simpler language: Time is just many many moments.
A flying arrow cannot be moving at any single moment.
Therefore it cannot move at any moment.
Therefore it cannot move!

Sounds reasonable?
But of course we know it is false.
So what do you think?

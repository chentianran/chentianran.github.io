My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

<!-- ## Prerequisite -->

    ISBN: 978-0-13-446929-4

## Course objectives

Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to

1. State and apply the definition of a function.
1. Identify domain and range of a given function or its graph.
1. Understand and find composite and inverse functions.
1. Use the graphing transformations to form new functions from original functions.
1. Build and analyze the graphs of functions.
1. Solve equations and inequalities.
1. Understand the properties of the following functions: polynomials, rational functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions.
1. Use function arithmetic to simplify expressions and evaluate functions.
1. Solve the system of equations using substitution and elimination methods.
1. Convert angles between degrees and radians.
1. Evaluate the trigonometric functions for a given angle.
1. Build and analyze the graphs of trigonometric functions and their inverses.
1. Apply the trigonometric identities to solve the trigonometric equations.
1. Use the law of Sines and the law of Cosines to solve oblique triangles
1. Understand the definition of polar coordinate system, and convert the points between polar and rectangular coordinate systems.

## Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore, your attendance is expected.
_Students missing 6 or more classes without an approved excuse
will receive an F grade_.
<!-- The AUM Attendance Policy is as follows.
Absences must be justified with an official written excuse.

1. official university events with excuses provided in advance by the head of the University unit involved (e.g. for intercollegiate athletic matches, required academic events/academic travel)
2. student illness/medical emergency or medical emergency for member of student’s immediate family
3. death of a member of student’s immediate family
4. military orders (notification should occur prior to the absence)
5. jury duty or court subpoena (notification should occur prior to the absence)
6. religious holiday (notification should occur prior to the absence)
7. weather emergencies or perilous driving conditions (with notification if feasible) -->

## Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular,

* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ record lectures without permission
* __DO NOT__ use cell phones

More detailed code of conduct will be drafted and discussed
collectively on the first day of class.

## Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing exercise problems.
However, they are _not required nor necessary_.
<!-- Essentially you only need a basic calculator that is capable of performing arithmetic and exponent calculation. -->
All tests are designed so that no calculator will be needed,
but a basic graphing calculator such as the TI-84 (TI-83, TI-82)
may be used during tests.
Note, however, calculators with CAS capability such as TI-89 or higher or similar
(Typically with a QUERTY keyboard) are __not allowed__ in any tests.

## Reading assignments

You are expected to read the assigned textbook
in preparation for each class meetings.
Please see the course page for detail.

<!-- ### Reading tests

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
__No late submission will be accepted__.
However, a missing reading test may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish the reading test at least a few days
before the due date.

Each reading test allows multiple attempts.
Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail. -->

## The main test

## Grade composition

Your course grade is determined by the total of according to the following
weighted average.

| Component     | Points |
|---------------|--------|
| Reading tests | 10     |
| Experience    | 15     |
| The main test | 75     |

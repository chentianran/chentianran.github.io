# MATH-3660

This is an introductory course on linear algebra
and the theory of systems of linear equations
with a strong emphasis on its computational aspect
as well as their real-world applications.
The primary focus will be on the theory and applications of
matrices algebra and various matrix decomposition methods.
Secondary focus will revolve around the idea of matrices as linear transformations
and the concept of vector spaces.
This will be a project-based course that emphasize on hands-on experiences.

<!-- ## Misc.

* Definition: _A __lecture__ is a process in which information passes
  from the notes of the lecturer into the notes of the student
  without passing through the minds of either._
  Funny, but true.
  But it really shouldn't be.
  Let's make sure our lectures are not like that. -->

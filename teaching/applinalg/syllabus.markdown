## What we will learn

This is an introductory course on linear algebra
and the theory of systems of linear equations
with a strong emphasis on its computational aspect
as well as their real-world applications.
This will be a project-based course that emphasize on hands-on experiences.
In this semester, we will cover...

* Algebraic operations involving vectors
* Vectors as representation of high-dimensional data points 
* Linear independence
* Subspaces
  * Basis
  * Dimension
* Inner product spaces
* Linear functions
  * Linearization of nonlinear functions
  * Regression models
* Matrices as representations of linear functions
* Algebraic operations involving matrices
* Matrices from applications
  * Geometric transformations
  * Incident matrices
  * Convolution
* Rank of matrices
* Inverse matrices
* Orthogonal group and special orthogonal group
* (Optional) Pseudo-inverse
* Systems of linear equations
* Least squares problem
* Matrix decomposition/factorization
  * QR decomposition
  * Eigenvalue decomposition
  * Positive definite matrices
  * (Optional) SVD
  * (Optional) Cholesky decomposition
  * (Optional) Jordan canonical form
  * (Optional) Condition numbers
* Infinite dimensional vector space
* (Optional) Linear algebra in differential equations

Topics marked as "optional" will _not_ be discussed in detail in class,
but you will be invited to explore these topics in projects/assignments.
Additionally, we will examine various real-world applications related to the tools and concepts covered this semester.

<!-- ## Prerequisite

__MATH-1620__ (Calculus II) or an equivalent course

In order to succeed in this class,
a solid understanding of pre-calculus algebra
and basic calculus is necessary.
The ability to write formal proofs is also required. -->

## Textbook and lecture notes

* [Required]
  _Linear Algebra for Everyone_ by **Gilbert Strang**,
  ISBN: 978-1-7331466-3-0
* [Optional]
  _Applied Linear Algebra: The Decoupling Principle_
  (2nd Edition) 
  by **Lorenzo Sadun**,
  ISBN: 9780821844410
* Additional lecture notes and supplemental materials
  can be found on our course page.

<!-- The following textbooks are recommended (but not required) supplemental textbooks. -->
Kindly remember, the instructor won't be reading the textbook to you.
It is essential for you to undertake this responsibility.

## Attendance

Participation in in-class discussions is an important part
of your learning process.
Therefore, your attendance is expected.

## Code of conduct

Please show respect for others in the classroom and use common sense. Specifically, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ play video games
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ record lectures without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the meeting
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

## Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs
may be helpful in doing homework problems.
<!-- According to AUM Mathematics Department Calculator Policy,
students are required to have a graphing calculator
(TI-84 is recommended).
The use of such calculators may be required for certain homework problems
or in-class activities. -->
However, all in-class quizzes and exams are designed so that **no** calculator will be needed.
<!-- Therefore calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities -->
<!-- are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams. -->

<!-- ### Instruction method

In this semester, we will adopt a "blended flipped" model.
This means some of the lectures are delivered in _pre-recorded digital form_.
You are expected to watch/read/listen to these lecture and read our textbook.

In addition, you are expected to meet with me either in-person or virtually
(via Zoom) during regular class meetings.
In these meetings, I will answer your question, work on problem with you,
or have other discussions related to this course. -->

## Graded components

Your course grade will be determined by combining the scores you earn in various components. Some components will be completed during class meetings (in-class), while others will be done through our online learning system (Blackboard).

Please ensure that you are familiar with and have access to our online learning system. Additionally, note that you will not receive reminders from the instructor regarding assignment and test deadlines. It is your responsibility to keep track of this information using the "Calendar" feature in the online learning system.

### In-class "continuous assessment" worksheets

In-class practice is a crucial component of the learning process. You will receive weekly assessment tests, which will be recorded and contribute to your grade. However, the tests themselves are not graded.
(That is, you earn points just by taking them regardless how well you do in them)

### In-class quizzes

There will be a weekly in-class quiz to test our understanding of the material covered in previous meetings. If you miss a quiz, you can make it up at the end of the semester with valid reasons (such as military assignments, medical issues, or family emergencies) and proper documentation provided in advance. Otherwise, a missed quiz will receive a score of zero.

### Weekly surveys

Weekly surveys are brief questionnaires designed to evaluate your progress. Completing these surveys will earn you points that contribute to your overall grades.
_There will be no make-up surveys_.
However, a missed survey may be replaced by additional surveys
offered at the end of the semester.

### Projects

Projects are complex real-world problems that help you gain a deeper understanding of the material covered in class.

### Final exam

The final exam is scheduled to take place on __April 25__ at __1:30pm__.
It constitutes a major part of your course grade.
Alternatively, you may choose to complete an additional final project
(instead of a timed final exam).

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance
in the following graded components:

| Component              | Weight | Where/how  |
|------------------------|--------|------------|
| Assessment worksheets  |  26%   | In-class |
| Quizzes                |  26%   | In-class |
| In-class participation |   4%   | In-class |
| Surveys                |  14%   | In-class |
| Projects               |  20%   | Blackboard |
| Final exam/project     |  10%   | In person  |

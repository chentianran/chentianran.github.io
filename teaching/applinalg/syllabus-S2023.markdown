* Algebraic operations involving vectors
* Vectors as representation of high-dimensional data points
* Linear independence
* Subspaces
  * Basis
  * Dimension
* Inner product spaces
* Linear functions
  * Linearization of nonlinear functions
  * Regression models
* Matrices as representations of linear functions
* Algebraic operations involving matrices
* Matrices from applications

but you will be invited to explore these topics in projects/assignments.

<!-- ## Prerequisite

__MATH-1620__ (Calculus II) or an equivalent course

In order to succeed in this class,
a solid understanding of pre-calculus algebra
and basic calculus is necessary.
The ability to write formal proofs is also required. -->

## Textbook and lecture notes

- _Applied Linear Algebra: The Decoupling Principle_
  (2nd Edition) 
  by **Lorenzo Sadun**,
  ISBN: 9780821844410
- Additional lecture notes and supplemental materials
  can be found on our course page.
<!-- The required textbook is:
_Introduction to applied linear algebra_
by __Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe__
(ISBN 9781316518960) -->

<!-- The following textbooks are recommended (but not required) supplemental textbooks. -->
Please be aware that the instructor will **not**
read the textbook to you.
It is your responsibility to read the textbook.

## Attendance

Participation in in-class discussions is an important part
of your learning process.
Therefore, your attendance is expected.

## Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom or in virtual meetings 
and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ play video games
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ record lectures without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the meeting
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

## Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs
may be helpful in doing homework problems.
<!-- According to AUM Mathematics Department Calculator Policy,
students are required to have a graphing calculator
(TI-84 is recommended).
The use of such calculators may be required for certain homework problems
or in-class activities. -->
However, all in-class quizzes and exams are designed so that **no** calculator will be needed.
<!-- Therefore calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities -->
<!-- are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams. -->

<!-- ### Instruction method

In this semester, we will adopt a "blended flipped" model.
This means some of the lectures are delivered in _pre-recorded digital form_.
You are expected to watch/read/listen to these lecture and read our textbook.

In addition, you are expected to meet with me either in-person or virtually
(via Zoom) during regular class meetings.
In these meetings, I will answer your question, work on problem with you,
or have other discussions related to this course. -->

## Graded components

Your overall course grade will be determined
through a weighted sum of the scores you earn
in several components, which will be described below in detail.
Some of the components will be complete during class meetings (in-class)
while some other components will be completed through
our online learning system (Blackboard).

Please make sure you are familiar with and have access to
our online learning system.
Please also note that you will not receive reminders from the instructor
about the deadlines/dates of assignments/tests.
It is your responsibility to keep track of these information
through the "Calendar" feature in the online learning system.

### Reading tests

Reading relevant sections of the textbook/lecture notes
**before** each class meeting is
an important component of your learning process.

After reading the textbook and/or lecture notes,
you need to complete a short reading test through the Blackboard system.
__Late submissions will result in lower scores__
unless valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided, preferably _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish each reading test at least a few days
before the due date.

Please note that, in general, you will be asked to read textbook sections
and/or lecture notes **before** we discuss them in class.

<!-- Each reading test allows multiple attempts. -->
<!-- Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail. -->

### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests called "concept tests"
on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
Please see the "concept tests" folder on the Blackboard system for detail.
__Late submissions will result in lower scores__

<!-- ### Worksheets

Working on concrete computational problems is an important component
of your learning process.
You will be given exercise problems to work on at the end of each lecture.
These exercise worksheets will be collected,
and they will graded mostly based on effort (rather than correctness). -->

### In-class and online quizzes

Short quizzes will be given to assess your overall understanding
of the course material.
__No makeup quiz will be offered__.
However, a missing quiz may be replaced by additional online quizzes
if valid reasons (military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of zero.

### Weekly survey

Each week you will be asked to complete a survey.
The surveys are designed to assist you in your reflection
on what you learned each week.
It is also an effective way to ask long-form questions.
__Late submissions will receive lower scores__.

### Homework assignments

Homework assignments can be found on the Blackboard system.
All homework assignment are open-book & open-internet assignments.
However, you must complete the assignment independently.
Copied-and-pasted answers will be considered as plagiarism (see below).
__Late submission will receive lower scores__
unless valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided, preferably _in advance_.

<!-- ### Quizzes

You will be expected to complete short quizzes during class meetings.
These quizzes will form a major component of your course grade.
__No makeup quiz will be offered__ unless valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided (ideally _in advance_). -->

<!-- Each quiz will provide a list of problems,
**you only need to complete 2 of them**.
Please clearly mark the problems you selected. -->

<!-- Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of zero. -->

<!-- In in-person or virtual problem sessions,
you will be given worksheets that contain short problems for you to complete.
There are 20 worksheets in total, you can try to complete each worksheet multiple times,
although you will only have at most one attempt on any worksheet in each problem session.
In each attempt, you can... -->

<!-- * work on problems by yourself under time limit,
  in which case your result will be graded; or
* ask me to show you how to do the problems,
  in which case your result will not be graded. -->

<!-- Note that you will receive slightly different versions of the same problem in each attempt. -->

<!-- In-class practice is a crucially important component of the learning process.
Your in-class worksheets will be _collected and graded_. -->

### Projects

Projects are more complicated real-world problems
that will guide you to gain deeper understanding
of the material we learn in class.

### Final exam

The final exam is scheduled to take place on __May 1st__ at __10:45 AM__.
It constitutes a major part of your course grade.
Alternatively, you may choose to complete an additional final project
(instead of a timed final exam).

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance
in the following graded components:

| Component          | Weight | Where/how  |
|--------------------|--------|------------|
| Homework           |  20%   | Blackboard |
| Reading tests      |  20%   | Blackboard |
| Concept tests      |  20%   | Blackboard |
| Surveys            |   5%   | Blackboard |
| Projects           |   5%   | Blackboard |
| Quizzes            |  20%   | In person  |
| Final exam/project |  10%   | In person  |

        There are actually three possibilities.

    <h3>Efficiency considerations</h3>
    <p>
        Square linear systems in real-world applications
        tend to be large.
        When we care about efficiency,
        we generally avoid computing matrix inverse.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        They can be solved much more efficiently
        with "matrix decompositions".
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col">
            <p class="fragment">
                A very useful decomposition
                is called the <em class="highlight">QR decomposition</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
                Every (real) square matrix $A$
                can be "decomposed" into a product

                    A = QR
                \]

                and $R$ is an <em class="highlight">upper triangular</em> matrix.

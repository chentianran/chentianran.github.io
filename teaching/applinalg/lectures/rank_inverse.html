        The "rank" of a matrix measures
        the maximum number of linear independent rows or columns in the matrix,
        and it is an important numerical quantity associated with a matrix.
        Square matrices that have the maximum rank
        have something called "inverse".

    <h3>Review: matrices</h3>
    <p>
        Recall that matrices are simply rectangular arrays of numbers.
        E.g.,
        \[  
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 2 \\
                3 & 5
            \end{bmatrix}
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Of course, things only become interesting when we
        define sum and product between matrices
        <span class="fragment">
            and interpret matrices as representations of
            linear functions between (finite dimensional) vector spaces.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        For example, the matrix above represents the linear function
        \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
                x \\ y
            \end{bmatrix}
            \quad\mapsto\quad
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 2 \\
                3 & 5
            \end{bmatrix}
            \;
            \begin{bmatrix}
                x \\ y
            \end{bmatrix}
            =
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1x + 2y \\
                3x + 5y
            \end{bmatrix},
        \]
        which sends vectors in the plane to vectors in the plane.

    <h3>Column rank of a matrix</h3>
    <div class="definition">
        For a matrix $A$,

        and this number is the column rank.

    <h3>Rank of a matrix</h3>
    <p>
        It turns out, despite the rather different definitions,
        the column rank and row rank of a matrix are always the same.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem fragment">
        Given a matrix $A$, its column rank equals its row rank.
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        One consequence is that $A$ and $A^\top$
        have the same column/row ranks.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Therefore, we simply call this number the
        <b class="highlight">rank</b> of the matrix $A$
        and use the notation $\operatorname{rank} A$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        This turns out to be an important quantity of a matrix.
        It tells us a great deal of information
        about the corresponding linear function.

    <h3>Rank, as a measurement of range</h3>
    <p>
        The rank of a matrix $A$ measures how "big"
        is the range the associated linear function
        $f(\mathbf{x}) = A \mathbf{x}$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        That is, the rank of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$
        is exactly the <em class="highlight">dimension</em> of the set
        \[
            \{ A \mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \}
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        For example, the function
        \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
                x \\
                y
            \end{bmatrix}
            \;\mapsto\;
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 0 \\

            \end{bmatrix}
            \begin{bmatrix}
                x \\
                y
            \end{bmatrix}
        \]
        "projects" the entire plane onto the $x$-axis
        (horizontal axis).
        <span class="fragment">
            The rank of the matrix, i.e. the dimension of the range,

    <h3>Full rank square matrices</h3>
    <p>
        A <em class="highlight">square</em> $n \times n$ matrix $A$

        if its rank is $n$ (the maximum possible rank).

    <p>
        Full rank square matrices come in pairs
        with a very special relationship.

    <h3>Inverse of a square matrix</h3>
    <div class="definition">
        For a <em>square</em> matrix $A$,
        if there is a matrix $B$ of the same size such that
        \[  
            \begin{aligned}
                AB &= I
                &&\text{and} &
                BA &= I
            \end{aligned},
        \]
        then $B$ is called an <b class="highlight">inverse matrix</b> of $A$
        (or simply an <b class="highlight">inverse</b> of $A$).
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        It is important to note that some matrix
        may not have an inverse at all.
        An non-example is
        \[
            A =
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 0 \\
                0 & 0
            \end{bmatrix}

    <h3>Notation and adjectives</h3>

    <h3>A word about left/right inverses</h3>

    </p>
    <div class="problem">
        (Not as easy as it looks)
        The definition of matrix inverse requires us to check both
        $AB = I$ and $BA = I$ before we declare $B$ to be the inverse of $A$.
        Do we have to check both directions?
        Or will $AB = I$ automatically imply $BA = I$? Explain why.

    <h3>Algebraic properties of matrix inverse</h3>
    <p>
        It is straightforward to verify the following:
        \[  
            \begin{aligned}
                (A^{-1})^{-1} &= A &
                (A^\top)^{-1} &= (A^{-1})^\top \\
                (AB)^{-1} &= B^{-1} A^{-1} &
                (A^n)^{-1} &= (A^{-1})^n.
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        You should spend some time to explain why each one is true.

    <h3>Invertible vs full rank</h3>
    <p>
        It turns out there is a simple description of invertible matrices:
        they are exactly square matrices of full rank.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem fragment">
        An $n \times n$ square matrix $A$ is invertible
        if and only if
        \[
            \operatorname{rank} A = n,

        It may be quite confusing that, in linear algebra,
        there are multiple different ways of saying the same thing.
        This is actually a feature, not a bug.

    <h3>Inverse matrix and inverse function</h3>
    <p>
        For an $n \times n$ matrix $A$,
        we can consider the linear function
        $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ given by
        \[ f(\mathbf{x}) = A \mathbf{x}. \]
    </p>
    <p>
        If $A$ has an inverse $A^{-1}$,
        then it is easy to verify that $f$ also has an inverse function,
        and this inverse function is given by
        \[
            f^{-1}(\mathbf{x}) = A^{-1} \mathbf{x}.

        Matrix determinant is a particularly useful tool

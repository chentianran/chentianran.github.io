# MATH-3660 lecture slides

A partial list of lecture slides can be found here.
This list is not complete (and that is intentional).
Lectures that are designed to be more interactive
will _not_ have corresponding slides.
Also, please be aware that the slides do not reflect
the deeper discussion involved in each class meeting.

# MATH-3660 lecture slides

A partial list of lecture slides can be found here.
This list is not complete (and that is intentional).
Lectures that are designed to be more interactive
will _not_ have corresponding slides.
Also, please be aware that the slides do not reflect
the deeper discussion involved in each class meeting.

* Lecture 1: [Vectors](vectors/)
* Lecture 2: [Linear dependence/independence](independence/)
* Lecture 3: [Span and subspaces](subspace/)
* Lecture 4: [Basis and dimension of subspaces](basis/)
* Lecture 5: [Inner product spaces](innerprod/)
* Lecture 6: Things that can be considered as "vectors"
* Lecture 7: [Linear/affine functions and regression models](regression/)
* Lecture 8: [Matrices as representations of linear functions](matrices/)
* Lecture 9: [Matrix-matrix products](matrixprod/)
* Lecture 10: Matrices from applications
* Lecture 11: Rank and inverse of matrices
* Lecture 12: Different types of matrices
* Lecture 13: Orthogonal group and special orthogonal group (optional)
* Lecture 14: Systems of linear equations
* Lecture 15: Least squares problem
* Lecture 16: QR decomposition
* Lecture 17: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* Lecture 18: Eigenvalue decomposition
* Lecture 19: Singular values
* Lecture 20: Singular value decomposition (optional)

We also have additional lectures discussions on specific aspects
applications of things we learned.

* Application 1: [Images and pixels](images/)
* Application 2: [Sound signal](sound/)

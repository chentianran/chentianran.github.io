            The analysis and generation of sound signals
            rely heavily on the vector space (and inner product space) structures.

        What is sound?
    </h3>
    <p>
        In physics, <em>sound</em> is simply
        vibration propagates as an acoustic wave in some medium.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        For most of us, this is simply the vibration of air.
        <span class="fragment">
            And in air, sound is transmitted as "longitudinal waves", a.k.a. "compression waves".
        </span>

    <h3>Creating sound out of sine and cosine</h3>
    <p>
        We can generate a pressure wave, in air,
        with relative pressure given by
        \[
            f(t) = A \sin (k \cdot 2\pi t)
        \]
        where $A$ and $k$ are positive real numbers representing
        <b class="highlight">amplitude</b> and <b class="highlight">frequency</b>
        of the wave.
        <span class="fragment">
            This models actual waves very accurately.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        It is convenient to use <em>second</em> as the unit for $t$ (time).
        <span class="fragment">
            While the standard unit for $A$ (and hence $f$ itself)
            should be <em>Pascal</em>, this is rarely used.
            Instead, $A$ is usually expressed as percentage
            (e.g. 25%, 90%, etc).
        </span>
        <span class="fragment">
            The standard unit for $k$ is <em>hertz</em> (Hz).
        </span>
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Amplitude and frequency</h3>
    <p>
        In the wave,
        \[
            f(t) = A \sin (k \cdot 2\pi t)
        \]
        the amplitude roughly correspond to loudness
        <span class="fragment">
            (although loudness is a complicated function of amplitude).
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        The frequency, $k$ (measured in Hz), corresponds to pitch
        (i.e., higher or lower notes).
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Our ears can hear certain range of amplitude and frequency.
        <span class="fragment">
            Do you know the human hearing range? What about that for dogs?

    <h3>Scalar multiple of a sine wave</h3>
    <p>
        For a wave,
        \[
            f_0(t) = \sin (440 \cdot 2 \pi t)
        \]
        <span class="fragment">
            scalar multiple of $f_0$ with a positive $r \in \mathbb{R}$,
            \[
                r \cdot f_0(t) = r \sin (440 \cdot 2 \pi t)
            \]
            corresponds to a change of amplitude (louder or quieter).
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Negative scalars can also be used,
        but they will also invert the "phase".
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Sum of sine waves</h3>
    <p>
        Two sine waves of different frequencies
        can be added together (as functions), e.g.
        \[
            \sin (440 \cdot 2 \pi t) +
            \sin (880 \cdot 2 \pi t)
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        This operation corresponds to playing/hearing
        two sound at the same time.
        (That's how waves combine)
    </p>

    <h3>Linear combinations</h3>
    <p>
        By combine scalar multiplication
        and sum of sine waves,
        we can create linear combinations of waves,
        e.g.
        \[
            a \cdot f_1(t) + b \cdot f_2(t).
        \]
        Can you interpret the physical meaning of this operation?
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        In general, it is possible to combine an arbitrary number of
        sine waves through linear combinations:
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^n a_k \cdot f_k(t)
        \]
        where each $f_k$ is a sine wave and $a_k$ is a real number.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Infinite sum</h3>
    <p>
        In general, we can consider arbitrary linear combinations
        of sine waves of frequencies 1Hz, 2Hz, 3Hz,... (to infinity)
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k \sin(k \cdot 2\pi t) 
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment lowlight">
        In more rigorous studies, we must consider the question of convergence.
        In this course, for simplicity, we will ignore this question
        and only consider the symbolic aspect of such sums.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Phase</h3>
    <p>
        So far we only considered the frequencies of sine waves.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        There is another parameter: <em>phase</em>,
        which allows us to shift the graph of sine horizontally
        and construct general "sine-like" waves.
    </p>
    <div class="definition fragment">
        A <b class="highlight">sinusoid</b>,
        (aka. a <b class="highlight">sine wave</b>),
        is a a scaled version
        of the graph of the sine function,
        i.e., the graph of a function
        \[
            f(t) = A \sin(2k\pi t + \phi),
        \]
        where $A,k,\phi$ are real numbers.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li class="fragment">
            $A$ is still the <b class="highlight">amplitude</b>
            (peak deviation from zero).
        </li>
        <li class="fragment">
            $k$ still is the <b class="highlight">frequency</b>
            (number of cycles over $[0,1]$).
        </li>
        <li class="fragment">
            $\phi$ is the <b class="highlight">phase</b>
            (horizontal shift of the graph).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="fragment">
        What we discussed previously is simply the special case
        of $\phi = 0$.

    <h3>
        Cosine waves are sine waves too
    </h3>
    <p>
        Recall that
        \[
            \cos(t) = \sin(t + \pi/2).
        \]
        That is, cosine is exactly a shifted version of the sine function.
        <span class="fragment">
            (We shift the graph of sine to the left by $\pi/2$)
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Therefore, cosine waves are sine waves (sinusoids) too!

    <h3>Sine-cosine form</h3>
    <p>
        The expression
        \[
            A \sin(2k\pi t + \phi),
        \]
        for a general sine wave is not very convenient for computation.
        <span class="fragment">
            An equivalent sine-cosine form is generally preferred.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Using trig. identities,
        the above can be transformed into
        \[
            a \cos(2k\pi t) + b \sin(2k\pi t),
        \]
        where $a,b$ are real numbers
        that can be computed from $A$ and $\phi$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        In this form, the amplitude and phase

    <h3>Linear combinations of sine waves</h3>
    <p>
        Like before,
        we can consider linear combinations of sine waves,
        e.g.,
        \[
            \alpha A_1 \sin(2k_1\pi t + \phi_1) +
            \beta  A_2 \sin(2k_2\pi t + \phi_2).
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        ...or in the sine-cosine form
        \[
            \alpha [a_1 \cos(2k_1 \pi t) + b_1 \sin(2k_1 \pi t)] +
            \beta  [a_2 \cos(2k_2 \pi t) + b_2 \sin(2k_2 \pi t)].
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Linear combinations of sine waves of
        <em>different</em> frequencies
        may <b>not</b> be sine waves.

        <span class="fragment">
            By combining different sine waves,

    <h3>Vector space of waves</h3>
    <p>
        For range of frequencies,
        say $k=1,\ldots,N$,
        we consider the set
        \[
            V = \left\{
                    \sum_{k=1}^N
                    a_k \cos(2k\pi t) + b_k \sin(2k\pi t)
                    \;:\;
                    a_k,b_k \in \mathbb{R}
                \right\}.
        \]
        <span class="fragment">
            which include combinations of sine waves
            of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, ..., $N$ Hz
            (as well as all different phase parameters).
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        $V$ has a natural

        It may feel rather strange to talk about angle between waves,
        but this is a generalization of angle between geometric vectors.

        Strange or not, it is actually quite useful,
        as it allows us to talk about orthogonality in this space.

    <h3>Orthogonal waves</h3>
    <p>
        Following our definition of "angles" between waves,
        we say two waves $f$ and $g$ are
        <b class="highlight">orthogonal</b> to each other if
        \[
            \langle f, g \rangle = 0.
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        That is,
        \[
            0 =
            \langle f, g \rangle =
            \int_{-\frac{1}{2}}^{\frac{1}{2}} f(t) \, g(t) \, dt.
        \]

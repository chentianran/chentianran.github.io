            The analysis and generation of sound signals
            rely heavily on the vector space (and inner product space) structures.
            In this lecture we extend the concept of vector spaces
            to allow inclusion of sound signals.

        What is sound?
    </h3>
    <p>
        In physics, <em>sound</em> is simply
        vibration propagates as an acoustic wave in some medium.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        For most of us, this is simply the vibration of air.
        <span class="fragment">
            And in air, sound is transmitted as "longitudinal waves", a.k.a. "compression waves".

    <h3>Creating sound out of sine and cosine</h3>
    <p>
        We can generate a pressure wave, in air,
        with relative pressure given by
        \[
            f(t) = A \sin (k \cdot 2\pi t)
        \]
        where $A$ and $k$ are positive real numbers representing
        <b class="highlight">amplitude</b> and <b class="highlight">frequency</b>
        of the wave.
        <span class="fragment">
            This models actual waves very accurately.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        It is convenient to use <em>second</em> as the unit for $t$ (time).
        <span class="fragment">
            While the standard unit for $A$ (and hence $f$ itself)
            should be <em>Pascal</em>, this is rarely used.
            Instead, $A$ is usually expressed as percentage
            (e.g. 25%, 90%, etc).
        </span>
        <span class="fragment">
            The standard unit for $k$ is <em>hertz</em> (Hz).
        </span>
    </p>

    <h3>Amplitude and frequency</h3>
    <p>
        In the wave,
        \[
            f(t) = A \sin (k \cdot 2\pi t)
        \]
        the amplitude roughly correspond to loudness
        <span class="fragment">
            (although loudness is a complicated function of amplitude).
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        The frequency, $k$ (measured in Hz), corresponds to pitch
        (i.e., higher or lower notes).
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Our ears can hear certain range of amplitude and frequency.
        <span class="fragment">
            Do you know the human hearing range? What about that for dogs?
        </span>

    <h3>Scalar multiple of a sine wave</h3>
    <p>
        For a wave,
        \[
            f_0(t) = \sin (440 \cdot 2 \pi t)
        \]
        <span class="fragment">
            scalar multiple of $f_0$ with a positive $r \in \mathbb{R}$,
            \[
                r \cdot f_0(t) = r \sin (440 \cdot 2 \pi t)
            \]
            corresponds to a change of amplitude (louder or quieter).
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Negative scalars can also be used,
        but they will also invert the "phase".
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Sum of sine waves</h3>
    <p>
        Two sine waves of different frequencies
        can be added together (as functions), e.g.
        \[
            \sin (440 \cdot 2 \pi t) +
            \sin (880 \cdot 2 \pi t)
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        This operation corresponds to playing/hearing
        two sound at the same time.
        (That's how waves combine)
    </p>

    <h3>Linear combinations</h3>
    <p>
        By combine scalar multiplication
        and sum of sine waves,
        we can create linear combinations of waves,
        e.g.
        \[
            a \cdot f_1(t) + b \cdot f_2(t).
        \]
        Can you interpret the physical meaning of this operation?
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        In general, it is possible to combine an arbitrary number of
        sine waves through linear combinations:
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^n a_k \cdot f_k(t)
        \]
        where each $f_k$ is a sine wave and $a_k$ is a real number.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Infinite sum</h3>
    <p>
        In general, we can consider arbitrary linear combinations
        of sine waves of frequencies 1Hz, 2Hz, 3Hz,... (to infinity)
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k \sin(k \cdot 2\pi t) 
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment lowlight">
        In more rigorous studies, we must consider the question of convergence.
        In this course, for simplicity, we will ignore this question
        and only consider the symbolic aspect of such sums.

    <h3>Matrix decomposition</h3>
    <p>
        A <em class="highlight">decomposition</em>
        of a matrix is simply the process of expressing a matrix
        as the product of two or more matrices.
        E.g.,
        \[
            A = X Y
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        This is similar to the problem of factorize integers
        or polynomials,
        <span class="lowlight">
            which is why matrix decompositions

    <h3>QR-decomposition (square case)</h3>
    <p>
        <em>QR-decomposition</em> is a special of decomposing a matrix
        that is particularly useful in solving linear least-squares problems.
        It is closely related to the "<em>Gram-Schmidt process</em>"
        that is used to create orthogonal basis.
    </p>
    <div class="definition fragment">
        For any square $n \times n$ matrix $A$,
        there exists an <em>orthogonal</em> $n \times n$ matrix $Q$
        and an <em>upper triangular</em> $n \times n$ matrix $R$
        such that
        \[
            A = QR.
        \]
        This factorization is known as a
        <b class="highlight">QR-decomposition</b> of $Q$.

    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col">
            <p class="fragment">
                Recall that $Q$, being orthogonal, must be nonsingular.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
                Also, $R$ is nonsingular if and only if $A$ is nonsingular.

    <h3>What's the point?</h3>
    <p>
        It is inherently difficult to appreciate the value of
        the QR-decomposition (or matrix decomposition in general)
        in classroom-settings.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment lowlight small">
        The real usefulness <em>only</em> become apparent
        when dealing with very large matrices (real-world applications)
        or matrices with floating-point entries (numerical analysis).

                    A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}

        The true benefit is that orthogonal matrices have the best

                Recall that orthogonal linear transformations
                preserve vector norms. That is,
                \[
                    \| Q \mathbf{x} \| = \| \mathbf{x} \|
                \]

                and <em>any</em> vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

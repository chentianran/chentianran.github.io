            The least-squares problem is one of the fundamental problems
            in numerical computations
            and it is closely linked to many problems in data science.

    <h3>Review: linear systems</h3>
    <p>
        Recall that a system of linear equations can be
        expressed as a single equation in the matrix-vector form
        \[
            A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
        \]
        where $A$ contains the coefficients,
        $\mathbf{x}$ is a column vector containing the unknowns,
        and $\mathbf{b}$ collects the constant terms on the r.h.s.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Such a linear system has natural geometric interpretations.
        However, there are multiple different interpretations,
        depending on our point of views.
        <span class="fragment lowlight">
            Holding these very different interpretations
            at the same time is an important skill we need to develop.

    <h3>Overdetermined system</h3>
    <p>
        Using the "row" interpretation,
        it is easy to see why a system of 3 equations in 2 unknowns
        may not have a solution
        <span class="lowlight">
            (unless the configuration of the 3 lines is very "special").

    <h3>When there is no solution......</h3>
    <p>
        It is common, in applications, to encounter linear systems
        that has no solutions, i.e., we cannot there is no $\mathbf{x}$
        such that
        \[
            A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}.
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        The next best thing is to find the <em class="highlight">"best"</em>
        solution to
        \[
            A \mathbf{x} \approx \mathbf{b}
        \]

                But what does <em>"best"</em> mean?
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
                One choices is to <em>minimize</em>
                the difference between $A \mathbf{x}$
                and $\mathbf{b}$,
                which is known as the
                <b class="highlight">residual</b>.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
                That is, we aim to find $\mathbf{x}$ that will minimize
                $\| A \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b} \|$.
                <span class="fragment small">
                    For technical reasons (calculus),
                    it is much easier to minimize
                    the square of this instead.

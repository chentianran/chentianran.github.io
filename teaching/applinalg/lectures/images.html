            How to encoding images as vectors in a vector space.
        </p>
    </div>
        <p>
            Digital images may be encoded as vectors in certain vector spaces.
            We already know of the basic ideas,
            in this lecture we will take a closer look at
            some of the technical detail.

                Digital images (uncompressed "bitmaps")

    <h3>
        Grayscale images

        For a grayscale image, each pixel is completely described by
        its "brightness", which can be represented by a single number.

        Colored images

    <p>
        For images with color, each pixel must be represented by
        several numbers.
        In the most commonly used "RGB" scheme,
        each pixel is represented by 3 numbers:
        the Red, Green, and Blue component of the color.

        Nearly all modern computers use the 24-bit color depth
        (8-bit per channel for the 3 channels).
        In this, 
        each of the "R", "G", "B" value range from 0 to 255
        with 0 being the lowest intensity
        and 255 being the highest intensity
        ($255 = 2^8 - 1$).
        When combined, they can represent over 16 million colors
        ($2^{24}$ distinct colors to be exact).

    <h3>RGB color space, revisited</h3>

        Consider the three unit vectors
        \[
            \mathbb{r} =
            \color{red}{
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1 \\ 0 \\ 0
            \end{bmatrix}
            }
            \;,\quad
            \mathbb{g} =
            \color{green}{
            \begin{bmatrix}
                0 \\ 1 \\ 0
            \end{bmatrix}
            }
            \;,\quad
            \mathbb{b} =

            \end{bmatrix}
            }
        \]
        they represent unit amount of red, green, and blue, respectively.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Any color can be represented as a linear combination of
        these three. E.g.,

    <h3>HSV color space, revisited</h3>
    <p class="lowlight small">
        You should have already seen the concept of "HSV color space"
        in homework assignments or projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value), and its variations,
        is a more intuitive alternative to the RGB color representation.
    </p>
    <ul class="fragment">
        <li>
            H: The <b>Hue</b> is represented by a number that corresponds to
            the position on the color wheel;
        </li>
        <li>
            S: The <b>Saturation</b> is represented by a number that
            show how pure the color is, independent from the hue
            (with 0 being a shade of gray and maximum value
            indicate the most pure and vibrant color);
        </li>
        <li>
            V: The <b>value</b> roughly corresponds to the brightness,
            i.e., the amount of light, independent from hue and saturation
            the color produces.

                Note that this also does not match $\mathbb{R}^3$ exactly

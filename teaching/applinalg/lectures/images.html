            How to encoding images as vectors in a vector space.
        </p>
    </div>
        <p>
            Digital images may be encoded as vectors in certain vector spaces.
            We already know of the basic ideas,
            in this lecture we will take a closer look at
            some of the technical detail.

                Digital images (uncompressed "bitmaps")
                are usually stored as a collection of "pixels" in computers.

                Each pixel can be represented as a number

                In our homework,

                and images as even longer vectors.

    <p class="lowlight fragment">
        Of course, there are images that are actually a combination of
        color information together with brightness information.
        Such formats are common in scientific instruments.

    <h3>
        Grayscale images
    </h3>
    <p>
        For a grayscale image, each pixel is completely described by
        its "brightness", which can be represented by a single number.
        (Usually larger number means brighter, and smaller number means darker)

    <h3>
        Colored images
    </h3>
    <p>
        For images with color, each pixel must be represented by
        several numbers.
        In the most commonly used "RGB" scheme,
        each pixel is represented by 3 numbers:
        the Red, Gree, and Blue component of the color.

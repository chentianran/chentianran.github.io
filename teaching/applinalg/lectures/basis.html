    <h3>Goal: defining basis and dimension</h3>
    <p>
        A common theme is the extraction of
        a set of linearly independent vector from a subspace
        that contains enough information to represent the subspace as a whole.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        That is the job of "basis".
        We will define this concept more precisely.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        A by-product is the concept of "dimension".
        <!-- Intuitively, $\mathbb{R}^1$ (the real line) should 1-dimensional,
        and $\mathbb{R}^2$ should be 2-dimensional.
        We will also give this term a precise meaning. -->

    <h3>A basis of the plane</h3>
    <p>
        Verify that the set
        \[
            \left\{
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    1 \\ 0
                \end{bmatrix}
                \,,\,
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    0 \\ 1
                \end{bmatrix}
            \right\}
        \]
        is linearly independent.
        <span class="fragment">
            Also verify that this set spans $\mathbb{R}^2$.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        That is, this subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is <em>both</em>
        <span class="highlight">linear independent</span> and
        <span class="highlight">spanning</span>.
        <!-- <span class="fragment">
            This is an example of a basis.

    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        These properties make it very special.
        In particular, every vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$
        can be written as a linear combination of this set.
        E.g.,
        \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
                3 \\ 5
            \end{bmatrix}
            =
            3
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1 \\ 0
            \end{bmatrix}
            +
            5
            \begin{bmatrix}
                0 \\ 1
            \end{bmatrix}.
        \]
        <span class="fragment">
            And this can be done in a unique way.
            (Must be 3 and 5; no other set of coefficients can make this work)

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <p>
        Show the two sets
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                \mathcal{B}_1 &= 
                \left\{
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 \\ 0
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    ,
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 \\ 1
                    \end{bmatrix}
                \right\}
                &
                \mathcal{B}_2 &= 
                \left\{
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 \\ 2
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    ,
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        3 \\ 5
                    \end{bmatrix}
                \right\}.
            \end{aligned}

        are both linearly independent,
        and they are both spanning sets of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

    <h3>Basis</h3>
    <div class="definition">
        For a subspace $V$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$
        (including the case where $V = \mathbb{R}^n$),
        a subset $B$ of $V$ is said to be a <b class="highlight">basis</b> of $V$ if
        <ul>
            <li>
                $B$ is linearly independent, and
            </li>
            <li>
                $B$ spans $V$ (i.e., $V = \operatorname{span}(B)$).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>
            Stated intuitively, a basis of a subspace
            is a subset of vectors in this subspace that is
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                small enough to be linearly independent, and
            </li>
            <li>
                large enough to span the subspace.

    <h3>A basis is not too big, not too small</h3>
    <p>
        We can push this intuitive idea of bases having just the "right size" even further.
        <!-- Recall that a basis of a subspace is both linearly independent and spanning.
        We can show that adding any element will make it linearly dependent,
        and removing any element will make it no longer a spanning set: -->
    </p>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>
            Let $B$ be a basis of a subspace $V$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For any $\mathbf{v} \in V \setminus B$,
                $B \cup \{ \mathbf{v} \}$ is linearly <em>dependent</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                For any $\mathbf{v} \in B$,
                the set $B \setminus \{ \mathbf{v} \}$ is <em>not</em> a spanning set of $V$.

    <h3>Dimension</h3>
    <div class="definition">
        The <b class="highlight">dimension</b> of $V$
        is the number of elements in a basis of $V$
        and is denoted by $\dim V$.
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        Implicit in this statement is the fact that any two basis for $V$
        must be of the exact same size.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        I.e.,
        if $B_1$ and $B_2$ are both bases of a subspace $V$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$,
        then $| B_1 | = | B_2 |$.
        This fact is not completely obvious.
        <span class="fragment lowlight">
            Indeed, it is a part of the "Basis Theorem".
            One intuitive explanation of this important fact is that
            a basis has to be of just the "right size".

        Exercise.
        Can you explain why this has to be true?

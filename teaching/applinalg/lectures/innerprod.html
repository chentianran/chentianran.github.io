    <h3>Don't forget about "dot" products</h3>
    <p>
        So far our discussions on subspaces and basis
        focused only on vector addition and scalar multiplication.
        But there is one more operation...
    </p>
    <p class="fragment centered highlight">
        <em>Dot product!</em>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        The <em class="highlight">dot product</em>
        \[
            \begin{bmatrix}
                x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n
            \end{bmatrix}

            =
            x_1 y_1 + \cdots x_n y_n
        \]
        produces a <em>scalar</em> (number).
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        It gives us one more thing we can do with vectors.

    <h3>Review: properties of dot products</h3>
    <p>
        We can verify that
        the dot product operation is "linear" in each factor.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        I.e., for two vectors
        $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
        and a real number $r$,
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                (r \mathbf{u}) \cdot \mathbf{v} &=
                r (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}),
                &&\text{and} &
                \mathbf{u} \cdot (r\mathbf{v}) &=
                r (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}),
            \end{aligned}
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Similarly,
        \[
            \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2) =
            (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}_1) +
            (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}_2)
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        This linearity property is important,
        as it tells us that the dot product operation interacts
        "nicely" with linear combinations:
        The dot product of a vector with a linear combination
        is exactly the weighted sum of dot products.

    <h3>About zero dot product</h3>
    <p>
        It is easy to see that for any $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$,
        \begin{align*}
            \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{0} &= 0
            &&\text{and} &
            \mathbf{0} \cdot \mathbf{v} &= 0
        \end{align*}
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        However, these are not the only cases where
        the dot product of two vectors can be zero.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Indeed, the dot product of two <em>nonzero</em> vectors can still be zero.
        <span class="fragment">
            E.g.,
            \[
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    2 \\ 0
                \end{bmatrix}
                \cdot
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    0 \\ 3
                \end{bmatrix}
                =
                2 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 3
                =
                0.
            \]
        </span>
        <span class="fragment">
            It is easy to come up with other examples,
            and they show us that the <em>dot product</em>
            behave very differently from product of real numbers.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        In general, from the fact that $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$
        we <b>cannot</b> conclude that $\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}$ or $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$.

    <h3>General inner product</h3>

## Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore, class attendance is expected.

<!-- Attendance will be taken at each class meeting.
A student is considered to be absent if they come in after attendance has been taken or leave more than five minutes early.   Perfect or near-perfect class attendance is important for students to gain and demonstrate competency in course concepts and skills. -->
You are expected to accept responsibility for class attendance
and to complete assignments and examinations as scheduled by the instructor.
You are solely responsible for catching up on material that
you miss due to any absence.
Be advised that missing first three class meetings
may disqualify you for financial aid.
For more information, see the list of acceptable reasons
for absences listed in the AUM Attendance Policy.

<!-- _Students missing 6 or more classes without an approved excuse
will receive an F grade_. -->
<!-- The AUM Attendance Policy is as follows.
Absences must be justified with an official written excuse.

1. official university events with excuses provided in advance by the head of the University unit involved (e.g. for intercollegiate athletic matches, required academic events/academic travel)
2. student illness/medical emergency or medical emergency for member of student’s immediate family
3. death of a member of student’s immediate family
4. military orders (notification should occur prior to the absence)
5. jury duty or court subpoena (notification should occur prior to the absence)
6. religious holiday (notification should occur prior to the absence)
7. weather emergencies or perilous driving conditions (with notification if feasible) -->

## Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular,

* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ record lectures without permission
* __DO NOT__ use cell phones

More detailed code of conduct will be drafted and discussed
collectively on the first day of class.

## Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
Essentially you only need a basic calculator that is capable of performing arithmetic and exponent calculation.
A graphing calculator such as the TI-84 (TI-83) is acceptable.
However, calculators with CAS capability such as TI-89 or higher or similar 
(Typically with a QUERTY keyboard) are __prohibited__ in all exams and quizzes.
<!-- Please bring the calculator to all class meetings and exams. -->
You may use the calculator for each test, but you will be required to show all work on tests.
If no work is shown, you will receive zero credit.
You are here to learn mathematics and a calculator should
only be used as a learning tool.

<!-- ## Reading assignments

You are expected to read the book in preparation of each class meetings.
Reading assignments, i.e., sections (from the required textbook) are listed
on the Blackboard system. -->
<!-- The reading assignments are to be completed _before_ each class meeting. -->

<!-- ### Reading tests

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
__No late submission will be accepted__.
However, a missing reading test may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish the reading test at least a few days
before the due date.

Each reading test allows multiple attempts.
Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail. -->

<!-- ### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
All concepts tests are due on the last day of classes,
and __no late submission will be accepted__.
However, it is strongly recommended that you complete them as early as possible. -->

<!-- ### Quizzes

Short in-class quizzes, designed to test our understanding of the material,
will be given at beginning of each class meetings.
These quizzes will be a major part of your course grade.
Since the solutions will be released on the same day,
__no makeup quiz will be offered__.
However, a missing quiz may be excused if valid reasons
(official university events, illness or medical emergencies,
death of immediate family, military orders, jury duty,
religious holidays, or extreme weather conditions)
and _proper documentation_ are provided (preferably _in advance_).
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of _zero_. -->

<!-- ### In-class worksheets

In-class practice is a crucially important component of the learning process
since this course focuses on actual programming skills.
Your in-class worksheets will be _collected and graded_. -->

<!-- ### Homework assignments

Homework problems are more complicated problems that will
guide you to gain deeper understanding of the material we learn in class.
Homework problems are listed on our Blackboard system.
The submission procedures are outlined in the listings.
__No late homework submission will be accepted__
However, a missing homework assignment may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing homework assignment receives a score of zero. -->

<!-- ### Final exam
The final exam is scheduled at 10:45am -- 12:00pm May 2nd. -->

## Exams

There will be three in-class exams and one accumulative final exam.
If you miss one midterm exam, the final exam will replace only one missed test for “excused” absences as outlined in the AUM Attendance Policy and only with appropriate verification.  If you miss two midterm exams, you will receive a zero for the second one unless you have extensive documentation for your absences. Being absent from the final exam will result in a course grade of FA unless you prove to the instructor’s satisfaction, and with appropriate documentation, that your absence was unavoidable.  You may then make up the final exam at the instructor’s convenience.  Your score on the final exam cannot be dropped.  

##  <a name="grade"></a> Grade composition
Your final grade is determined according to the following
weighted average.

| Component              | Points | Where    |
|------------------------|--------|----------|
| Continuous integration | 50%    | In-class |
| Experience points      | 10%    | In-class |
| Exam 1                 | 10%    | In-class |
| Exam 2                 | 10%    | In-class |
| Exam 3                 | 10%    | In-class |
| Final                  | 10%    | In-class |

### Grading scale

## AUM Inclusive Access Program

Math 1050 is part of the AUM Inclusive Access Program which provides instant access to the digital material needed for this course on the first day of class. You have a trial period (typically two weeks in a Fall/Spring semester, or one week in a summer semester) to decide whether or not you want to continue to use the digital course material provided or you can OPT-OUT and source the course material through alternative methods. After the trial period, those students choosing to remain in the AUM Inclusive Access Program will be charged by the All Inclusive Access book price (typically lower compared to the retail price) to your student account. For more information on the AUM Inclusive Access Program and directions on how to OPT-OUT of the program, please visit the following link: https://aumbookstore.com/inclusive-access.

Remember that opting-out of the AUM Inclusive Access Program does not remove you from your class. Opting-Out only removes your access to the digital course material provided for your class via the AUM Inclusive Access Program. Also, if you drop the class during the trial period, you will not be charged for the AUM Inclusive Access course material.

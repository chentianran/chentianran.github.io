# MATH-1050 B (CRN 3334) Summer 2019 Syllabus

This class is primarily for students who require a college level mathematics course but will not continue on to calculus; however, it can be used a prerequisite for Finite Math (MATH 1100), Pre-Calculus Algebra (MATH 1120), Pre-Calculus Algebra with Trigonometry (MATH 1150), or Trigonometry (MATH 1550), with a minimum grade of C in MATH 1050. Review topics include graphing basic functions, and linear, quadratic & rational expressions and equations.  Main topics include polynomial, rational, inverse, exponential, and logarithmic functions and their applications in business and science, inequalities, and systems of equations.

My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### Prerequisite

Grade of C# or better in MATH 0800 or an equivalent course,
a score of 20 on ACT, a score of 480 on the SAT, or a level 4
or better score on the AUM Mathematics Placement Test.

### Textbook

* [Required]
    _College Algebra Essentials_ __5th Edition__
    by Robert F. Blitzer, Pearson, 2018 
    ISBN: 978-0-13-446929-4

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Course objectives

Upon successful completion of this course the student will demonstrate an understanding of and ability to apply each of the following topics (time permitting):

* Solve/Graph/Apply Linear, Rational, and Quadratic equations, including for Linear Inequalities
* Graph basic functions (Quadratic, Absolute Value, Square Root) and their transformations
* Perform algebraic operations of functions and composition of functions
* Find inverse functions and their graphs
* Solve applications of Polynomial and Rational Functions
* Solve Systems of Linear Equations in two and three variables and their applications
* Exponential & Logarithmic Functions/Equations (graphing, solving, applying, properties)

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected.
_Students missing 6 or more classes without an approved excuse
will receive an F grade_.
<!-- The AUM Attendance Policy is as follows.
Absences must be justified with an official written excuse.

1. official university events with excuses provided in advance by the head of the University unit involved (e.g. for intercollegiate athletic matches, required academic events/academic travel)
2. student illness/medical emergency or medical emergency for member of student’s immediate family
3. death of a member of student’s immediate family
4. military orders (notification should occur prior to the absence)
5. jury duty or court subpoena (notification should occur prior to the absence)
6. religious holiday (notification should occur prior to the absence)
7. weather emergencies or perilous driving conditions (with notification if feasible) -->

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ record lectures without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
Essentially you only need a basic calculator that is capable of performing arithmetic and exponent calculation.
A graphing calculator such as the TI-84 (TI-83) is acceptable.
However, calculators with CAS capability such as TI-89 or higher or similar 
(Typically with a QUERTY keyboard) are __prohibited__ in all exams and quizzes.
Please bring the calculator to all class meetings and exams.
You may use the calculator for each test, but you will be required to show all work on tests.
If no work is shown, you will receive zero credit.
You are here to learn mathematics and a calculator should be used as a learning tool.

### Reading assignments

You are expected to read the book in preparation of each class meetings.
Reading assignments, i.e., sections (from the required textbook) are listed
on the Blackboard system.
<!-- The reading assignments are to be completed _before_ each class meeting. -->

### Reading tests

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
__No late submission will be accepted__.
However, a missing reading test may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish the reading test at least a few days
before the due date.

Each reading test allows multiple attempts.
Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail.

### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
All concepts tests are due on the last day of classes,
and __no late submission will be accepted__.
However, it is strongly recommended that you complete them as early as possible.

### Quizzes

Short in-class quizzes, designed to test our understanding of the material,
will be given at beginning of each class meetings.
These quizzes will be a major part of your course grade.
Since the solutions will be released on the same day,
__no makeup quiz will be offered__.
However, a missing quiz may be excused if valid reasons
(official university events, illness or medical emergencies,
death of immediate family, military orders, jury duty,
religious holidays, or extreme weather conditions)
and _proper documentation_ are provided (preferably _in advance_).
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of _zero_.

### In-class worksheets

In-class practice is a crucially important component of the learning process
since this course focuses on actual programming skills.
Your in-class worksheets will be _collected and graded_.

<!-- ### Homework assignments

Homework problems are more complicated problems that will
guide you to gain deeper understanding of the material we learn in class.
Homework problems are listed on our Blackboard system.
The submission procedures are outlined in the listings.
__No late homework submission will be accepted__
However, a missing homework assignment may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing homework assignment receives a score of zero. -->

<!-- ### Final exam
The final exam is scheduled at 10:45am -- 12:00pm May 2nd. -->

### Final exams ###

There will be a comprehensive Final Exam at the end of the semester.
Being absent from the Final Exam results in a grade of FAN.
You MUST have an AUM EXCUSED absence in order to take a make-up Final Exam.
Final Exam is scheduled on the last day of class.

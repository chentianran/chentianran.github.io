# MATH-1050

Designed primarily for non-STEM students,
this course will help you to develop your
logical thinking and problem-solving skills;
you will have the opportunity to apply your knowledge
and to make connections of algebraic concepts to real life applications.
You can find the current (or most recent)
course syllabus [here](syllabus/).

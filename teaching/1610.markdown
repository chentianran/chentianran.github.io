My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course 
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email:

### What we will learn

This is the first course in the calculus sequence.
We will focus on basic calculus concepts involving functions of one variable:
limits, derivatives, and integrals. 
Conceptual understanding is paramount. 
Mathematical rigor will be kept to the minimum, 
and concepts will be illustrated in at least three different ways: symbolically, geometrically, and numerically. 

### Prerequisite

In order succeed in this class, certain basic mathematical skills are necessary.
In particular, we need to feel comfortable manipulating algebraic expressions
and trigonomitric functions.
Formally, the prerequisite can be satisifed by any one of the following:

* MATH-1120 (Precalculus algebra) _and_ MATH-1550 (Trigonometry)
* MATH-1150 (Precalculus algebra with trigonometry)
* An ACT Math score of 25 or higher (620 on SAT)
* An appropriate score in the AUM Math Placement Test.

### Textbook

_Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (6th edition) by Larson & Edwards

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

You may use scientific calculators one quizzes or exams for basic arithmetics.
However, since these are designed to test your skills in algebra and calculus
(rather than your skill in using a calculator), you shall not rely on caculators
for algebraic manipulation, differentiation, or integration.
Therefore advanced graphing calculators such as TI-89 or TI-92 are not allowed 
on any of the quizzes and exams. 
Similarly, any smart devices with internet capabilities are also not allowed.

### Quizzes

There will be a short quiz at the beginning of _every_ class meeting to test
our understanding of the material discussed in the previous meeting.
No makeup quiz will be offerred. 
However, in computing the final grade, up to four missed quizzes will be dropped.
In other words, each student can miss up to four quizzes without affecting the
final grade.
In addition, two of the lowest quiz scores (that are not missed) will also be dropped.

### Exams

The in-class mid-term and final exams scheduled in this syllabus are mandatory 
and constitute major part of your grade.

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of quizzes, 
the mid-term exam, and the final exam, and is calculated according to the following weight.

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Quizzes | 50% | 
| Mid-term Exam | 25% |
| Final Exam | 25% |

as amended, (FERPA) requires institutions receiving federal monies to protect

My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course 
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.

### What we will learn

This is the first course in the calculus sequence.
We will focus on basic calculus concepts involving functions of one variable:
limits, derivatives, and integrals. 
In this course, conceptual understanding is paramount,
and mathematical rigor will be kept to the minimum.

### Prerequisite

In order succeed in this class, certain basic mathematical skills are necessary.
In particular, we need to feel comfortable manipulating algebraic expressions
and trigonomitric functions.
Formally, the prerequisite can be satisifed by any one of the following:

* MATH-1120 (Precalculus algebra) _and_ MATH-1550 (Trigonometry)
* MATH-1150 (Precalculus algebra with trigonometry)
* An ACT Math score of 25 or higher (620 on SAT)
* An appropriate score in the AUM Math Placement Test.

### Textbook

_Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (6th edition) by Larson & Edwards

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part 
of the learning process. 
Therefore attendance is expected. 

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

You may use scientific calculators one quizzes or exams for basic arithmetics.
However, since these are designed to test your skills in algebra and calculus
(rather than your skill in using a calculator), you shall not rely on caculators
for algebraic manipulation, differentiation, or integration.
Therefore advanced graphing calculators such as TI-89 or TI-92 are not allowed 
on any of the quizzes and exams. 
Similarly, any smart devices with internet capabilities are also not allowed.

### Quizzes

There will be a short quiz at the beginning of _every_ class meeting to test
our understanding of the material discussed in the previous meeting.
No makeup quiz will be offerred. 
However, in computing the final grade, up to _three_ missed quizzes will be dropped.
In other words, each student can miss up to _three_ quizzes without affecting the
final grade.
In addition, _two of the lowest_ quiz scores (that are not missed) will also be dropped.

### Exams

Two in-class exams and a final exam are mandatory and constitute 
major parts of your course grade.

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of quizzes, 
the in-class exams, and the final exam, and is calculated according to the 
following weights.

| Component  | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| Attendance | 5%     |
| Quizzes    | 45% | 
| Exam 1 | 15%% |
| Exam 2 | 15%
| Final Exam | 20% |

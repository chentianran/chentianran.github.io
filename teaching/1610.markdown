### What we will learn

This is the first course in the calculus sequence.
We will focus on basic calculus concepts involving functions of one variable:
limits, derivatives, and integrals. 
Conceptual understanding is paramount. 
Mathematical rigor will be kept to the minimum, 
and concepts will be illustrated in at least three different ways: symbolically, geometrically, and numerically. 

### Prerequisite

In order succeed in this class, certain basic mathematical skills are necessary.
In particular, we need to feel comfortable manipulating algebraic expressions
and trigonomitric functions.
Formally, the prerequisite can be satisifed by any one of the following:

* MATH-1120 (Precalculus algebra) _and_ MATH-1550 (Trigonometry)
* MATH-1150 (Precalculus algebra with trigonometry)
* An ACT Math score of 25 or higher (620 on SAT)
* An appropriate score in the AUM Math Placement Test.

### Textbook

_Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (6th edition) by Larson & Edwards

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

You may use scientific calculators for each test, but you will be required to show all work for the part of the mid-term exam and the final exam and if you rely on calculators for answers you will get a zero credit. Graphing calculators such as TI-89 or TI-92 are not allowed on any of the exams. Laptop computers, iPads, cell phones or other devices with internet capabilities are also not allowed. 

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of quizzes, the mid-term exam, and the final exam, and is calculated according to the following weight.

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Quizzes | 50% | 
| Mid-term Exam | 25% |
| Final Exam | 25% |

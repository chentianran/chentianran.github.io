My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course 
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.

### What we will learn

This is the first course in the calculus sequence.
We will focus on basic calculus concepts involving functions of one variable:
limits, derivatives, and integrals. 
In this course, conceptual understanding is paramount,
and mathematical rigor will be kept to the minimum.

### Prerequisite

In order succeed in this class, certain basic mathematical skills are necessary.
In particular, we need to feel comfortable manipulating algebraic expressions
and trigonomitric functions.
Formally, the prerequisite can be satisifed by any one of the following:

* MATH-1120 (Precalculus algebra) _and_ MATH-1550 (Trigonometry)
* MATH-1150 (Precalculus algebra with trigonometry)
* An ACT Math score of 25 or higher (620 on SAT)
* An appropriate score in the AUM Math Placement Test.

### Textbook

_Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (6th edition) by Larson & Edwards

Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from the textbook.

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part 
of the learning process. 
Therefore class attendance is expected and recorded. 
It is your responsibility to sign the attendance sheet at each class meeting. 
Moreover, in order to get a passing grade you should have attended at least 80% 
of the classes for which attendance was recorded.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people and use common sense.
In particular,

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom 
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems. 
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore calculators or any smart devices with internet capabilities 
are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

### Quizzes

There will be a short quiz at the beginning of _every_ class meeting to test
our understanding of the material discussed in the previous meeting.
No makeup quiz will be offerred.
However, a missing quiz may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.

In computing the final scores, _two of the lowest_ quiz scores (that are not missed) 
will be dropped.

### Exams

Two in-class exams constitute an important part of your course grade.
No makeup exams will be offerred,
but a missing exam may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.

The final exam is mandatory and constitute 
a major part of your course grade.

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of quizzes, 
the in-class exams, and the final exam, and is calculated according to the 
following weights.

| Component  | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| Attendance | 5%     |
| Quizzes    | 45% | 
| Exam 1 | 15%% |
| Exam 2 | 15%
| Final Exam | 20% |

### Grading scale

* B: 80% - 89% 
* C: 65% - 79%

Borderline grades are determined by in-class participation 
(in discussions and activities) as well as attandence.

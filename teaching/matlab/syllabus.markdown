My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

This course is an introduction to computer programming in a high-level language,
with emphasis on the use of the computer as a tool for engineering or science.

Course objectives:

* Background of the Matlab language and programming framework
* Basic structure and features of the Matlab language
  - Scalar variables
  - Arrays and multidimensional arrays
  - Mathematical constants
  - Array slicing
  - Branching statements
  - Loops
  - Functions and subroutines
* Plots using Matlab
* Advanced data structures in Matlab including sparse arrays and cells
* I/O functions in Matlab
* Graphics and animation
* Basic signal processing
* General programming skills in the context of Matlab

### Prerequisite

__MATH-1150__ (Precalculus and trigonometry)


### Textbook

- [Required] _Matlab: A practival introduction to programming and problem solving_
  (any edition) by Stormy Attaway (4th Ed. ISBN: 978-0-12-804525-1).

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected.
_Students missing 6 or more classes without an approved excuse
will receive an F grade_.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities
are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

### Reading assignments

You are expected to read the book in preparation of each class meetings.
Reading assignments, i.e., sections (from the required textbook) are listed
on the Blackboard system.
The reading assignments are to be completed _before_ each class meeting.

### Daily reading tests

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
__No late submission will be accepted__.
However, a missing reading test may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish the reading test at least a few days
before the due date.

Each reading test allows multiple attempts.
Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail.

### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
All concepts tests are due on the last day of classes,
and __no late submission will be accepted__.
However, it is strongly recommended that you complete them as early as possible.

### In-class worksheets

In-class practice is a crucially important component of the learning process
since this course focuses on actual programming skills.
Your in-class worksheets will be _collected and graded_.

### Weekly homework assignments

Homework problems are more complicated mathematical problems that will
guide you to gain deeper understanding of the material we learn in class.
They will be a major part of your course grade.
Homework problems are listed on our Blackboard system.
The submission procedures are outlined in the listings.
__No late homework submission will be accepted__
However, a missing homework assignment may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing homework assignment receives a score of zero.

### Final exam
The final exam is scheduled at 10:45am -- 12:00pm May 2nd.

{% include hours.markdown %}

My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

Use of mathematical models and computer simulations for solving real world problems.

### Prerequisite

* MATH-2660 (Linear algebra)

### Textbook

_No textbook is required._ However, the following books will be used as references:

- _A first course in mathematical modeling_ (4th edition)
  by F. Giordano, W. Fox, S. Horton, and M. Weir
  ISBN: 978-0-495-01159-0
- _An introduction to mathematical modeling_
  by E. Bender
  ISBN: 978-0-486-41180-4

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected and will be recorded.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Software programs

Computer programs are indispensable in mathematical modeling and simulation
as many basic tasks will be nearly impossible to do by hand.
Therefore you are expected to be able to use some software programs.
The following programs are _recommended_:

- Matlab / Octave
  (these two are nearly equivalent programs for numerical computations,
  but Octave is completely free)
- Mathematica / Maple / Sage / SymPy
  (these are the standard programs for symbolic computations, and among them
  Sage and SymPy are free)

You will be expected to be able to carry out basic calculations in
_at least_ one of the above software programs.

### Programming languages

Programming languages are the means by which you can ask computers to do things.
The ability to program is an essential skill in the modern job market.
In the context of computer simulation, basic programming skills can be very useful.
Familiarity with the following programming languages are
_not required but strongly recommended_:

- Matlab / Octave
- C / C++
- Python / Ruby
- Javascript

### Projects
This course is largely based on projects.
You are expected to spent much of your time in (team) projects.

### Discussions
Participation in in-class and online discussions will an important component
of the learning process as well as your scores.

### Final exam
The mandatory final exam is scheduled at 11:00am -- 12:00pm Dec. 5.

### Grade composition
Your final course grade is determined according to your overall performance in
(team) projects, in-class and online discussions, and the final exam.
It is calculated according to the following weights.

| Component        | Points |
|------------------|--------|
| Projects         |  800   |
| Discussions      |  150   |
| Final Exam       |   50   |

### Grading scale

* A: 90% - 100%
* B: 80% - 89.9%
* C: 70% - 79.9%
* D: 60% - 69.9%
* F: below 60%

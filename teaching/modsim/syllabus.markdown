{% include hours.markdown %}

My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

Use of mathematical models and computer simulations for solving real world problems.
Along the way, we will also learn how to use some of the basic mathematical tools.

### Prerequisite

* MATH-2660 or MATH-3660 (Linear algebra or applied linear algebra)
* MATH-1610 (Calculus I)

### Textbook

No physical textbook is required.
You will be provided lecture notes
and other online material.
- [Recommended, but _not_ required]
  _An introduction to mathematical modeling_
  by E. Bender
  ISBN: 978-0-486-41180-4
  (This is a very old book, and many topics in this book is outdated. We will only use this book for the fundamental topics.)

- [Recommended, but _not_ required]
  _A first course in mathematical modeling_ (4th edition)
  by F. Giordano, W. Fox, S. Horton, and M. Weir
  ISBN: 978-0-495-01159-0

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected and will be recorded.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Software programs

Computer programs are indispensable in mathematical modeling and simulation
as many basic tasks will be nearly impossible to do by hand.
Therefore you are expected to be able to use some software programs.
The following programs are _recommended_:

- Matlab / Octave
  (these two are nearly equivalent programs for numerical computations,
  but Octave is completely free)
- Mathematica / Maple / Sage / SymPy
  (these are the standard programs for symbolic computations, and among them
  Sage and SymPy are free)

You will be expected to be able to carry out basic calculations in
_at least_ one of the above software programs.

### Programming languages

Programming languages are the means by which you can ask computers to do things.
The ability to program is an essential skill in the modern job market.
In the context of computer simulation, basic programming skills can be very useful.
Familiarity with the following programming languages are
_not required but strongly recommended_:

- Matlab / Octave
- C / C++
- Python / Ruby
- Julia
- Javascript

<!-- ### Reading assignments

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
__No late submission will be accepted__.
However, a missing reading test may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish the reading test at least a few days
before the due date.

Each reading test allows multiple attempts (2 attempts).
Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail. -->

<!-- ### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
All concepts tests are due on the last week of classes,
and __no late submission will be accepted__.
However, it is strongly recommended that you complete them as early as possible. -->

### In-class worksheets

Worksheet problems will also be assigned in class.
Since these must be completed in class,
__no makeup worksheets will be offered__.
However, a missing worksheet may be replaced by
closed-book exams cover similar material.

### Homework assignments

Practice in problem solving is an important part of this course.
Problems will be assigned on the _Blackboard system_.
These problems will be graded and will be a major component
in your course grade.
You can discuss with others about these assignments,
however, you must submit your own solutions.

### Projects

This course is largely based on projects which are longer open-ended problems.
You are expected to spent much of your time in these projects.
<!-- You can discuss with others about these projects,
however, you must submit your own solutions. -->

### In-class participation

Participation in in-class discussions
will an important component
of the learning process.

### Grade composition

Your final course grade is determined by
performance in the following learning components.

| Component        | Points | Where      |
|------------------|--------|------------|
| Worksheets       | 65%    | In-class   |
| Participation    | 10%    | In-class   |
| Homework         | 10%    | Blackboard |
| Projects/final   | 15%    | Blackboard/in-class |

### Policy on AI usage

Artificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, 
may be used for homework assignments
__with appropriate citation__,
but not for projects, final exam, or in-class workseehts.
If you are in doubt as to whether you are
using AI language models appropriately in this course,
I encourage you to discuss your situation with me.
You are responsible for fact checking statements
composed by AI language models.

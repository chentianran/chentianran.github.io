My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 24hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

This is an undergraduate level course on abstract algebra
that follows Modern Algebra I.
Topics include rings, ideals, fields, modules, vector spaces, factorization,
field extensions, and Galois theory.

### Prerequisite

Modern Algebra I and certain level of "mathematical maturity".

### Textbook

- [Required] _Fundamentals of Modern Algebra: A Global Perspective_ by Robert Underwood
  (ISBN-13: [978-9814730297](http://a.co/4hw6KRC)

Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from these textbook.

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators, computer programs, and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent devices or software programs are
neither required nor allowed in exams.

### Homework problems
Practice is a crucial component in the learning process.
Certain exercise problems will be assigned weekly.
Each homework assignment is due the next Monday.

### In-class discussion
Participation in in-class discussion is an important component of the learning process.
Your participation will be recorded.

### Grade composition
Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance on
homework assignments, in-class discussions mid-term exam, and final exam.
It is calculated according to the following weights.

| Component     | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Discussion    |  15%   |
| Worksheets    |  25%   |
| Homework      |  60%   |

### Grading scale

* A: 90% - 100%
* B: 80% - 89.9%
* C: 70% - 79.9%
* D: 60% - 69.9%
* F: below 60%

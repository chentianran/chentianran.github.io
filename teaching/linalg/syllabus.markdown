My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

Linear algebra is the fundamental language for manipulating high-dimensional data.
We will cover...

* Systems of linear equations
* Vector space operations
* Matrix operations
* Matrix determinant
* LU and QR decompositions
* Eigenvalue and eigenvectors
* Singular values
* Abstract vector spaces
* Linear transformations
* Inner product space

### Prerequisite

In order to succeed in this class,
a solid understanding of algebra and basic calculus is necessary.
The ability to write formal proofs is also required.
Please check with the course catalog for all the prerequisite courses.

### Textbook

- [Required] _Linear Algebra and Its Applications_
  by __David C. Lay, Steven R. Lay, and Judi J. McDonald__
  (ISBN 978-0-13-427919-0)
- [Optional] _Linear Algebra Done Right_
  by __Sheldon Axler__
  (ISBN 978-3-319-30765-7)

Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from these textbook.

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities
are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

### Reading assignments

You are expected to read the book in preparation of each class meetings.
Reading assignments, i.e., sections (from the required textbook) are listed
on the Blackboard system.
The reading assignments are to be completed _before_ each class meeting.

### Daily reading tests

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
__No late submission will be accepted__.

### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.

### Weekly in-class quizzes

There will be a short quiz _every week_ to test
your understanding of the material discussed in the previous meetings.
__No makeup quiz will be offered__.
However, a missing quiz may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of zero.

### Weekly in-class worksheet

In-class practice is a crucially important component of the learning process.
Your in-class worksheets will be _collected and graded_.

### Weekly homework assignments

Homework problems are more complicated mathematical problems that will
guide you to gain deeper understanding of the material we learn in class.
They will be a major part of your course grade.
Homework problems are listed on our Blackboard system,
and _they must be submitted via the Blackboard system_.
__No late homework submission will be accepted__
However, a missing homework assignment may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing homework assignment receives a score of zero.

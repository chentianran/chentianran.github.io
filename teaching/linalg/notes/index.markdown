title: Simplified lecture note for linear algebra
---

This is a collection of simplified lecture notes for my linear algebra course.
This collection contains minimum amount of information
and is not intend to replace the textbook or lectures themselves.

- Linear systems
  - [Basics of linear systems](linear-systems/)
  - [Augmented matrices and elementary row operations](row-operations/)
  - [Linear systems with no solutions or infinitely many solutions](nonunique/)
- [Algebra of vectors](vectors/)
- Matrices
  - [Basics of matrices](matrices/)
  - [Matrices, linear systems, and linear transformations](matrix-connections/)
  - [Matrix products](matrix-product/)
  - [Matrix inverse](inverse/)
  - [2x2 matrix determinant](determinant-2x2/)
  - [3x3 matrix determinant](determinant-3x3/)
  - [General matrix determinant](determinant-general/)
  - [Computing inverse via row reduction](inverse-computation/)
- Vector spaces
  - [Span and linear independence](independence/)
  - [Row space, column space, and matrix rank](rank/)
  - [Subspace of the Euclidean vector spaces](space/)
  - [Null space](null/)

Please note that this collection of notes is intentionally written
to not follow the typical "definition-lemma-theorem" structure,
and thus differ from the adopted textbook significantly in terms of the structure.

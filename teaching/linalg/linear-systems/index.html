                    A <b class="term">linear system</b> 
                    is a system of simultaneous equations 
                    involving one or more <strong>unknowns</strong> 
                    (aka. <strong>variables</strong> / <strong>indeterminates</strong>) 
                    where each term of each equation is 
                    either a constant or a product between a constant and an unknown.

    <h3>Three basic operations</h3>
    <p>
        Three basic operations can be used to 
        systematically eliminate unknowns from equations 
        until we can see the solutions easily.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li class="fragment">Swapping two equations</li>
        <li class="fragment">Replacing an equation by a nonzero multiple of itself (both sides)</li>
        <li class="fragment">Replacing an equation by the sum of itself and a multiple of another</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="fragment">
        These operations do not alter the solution set. 
        Can you see why? 
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Note that <em>multiplying an equation by 0 is not allowed</em> 
        as that could change the solution set. 
        Similarly, <em>adding a multiple of an equation to itself is not allowed</em> in general, 
        for the same reason.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        These operations are the basis of the 
        elimination method we saw earlier,
        and we will soon see how this idea can be extended to
        larger systems involving more variables very soon.

    <h3>Determinant (2x2 case)</h3>

            It is easy to distinguish the case of having unique solution
            and the two other cases (infinitely many solutions or no solutions at all).

                One thing that can help us to determine if a
                linear system has a unique solution is
                <em>"determinant"</em>.

    <h3>Sidenote: the notation</h3>
    <p>
        Determinant is an important tool in mathematics.
        We will see it in several different context
        in linear algebra.
        For convenience, we use the notation
        \[
            \left|
            \begin{smallmatrix}
                a & b \\
                c & d
            \end{smallmatrix}
            \right|
            \; = \;
            ad - bc
        \]
        for the determinant.

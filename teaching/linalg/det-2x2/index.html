    <h3>Solution sets of linear system and 2x2 determinant</h3>
    <p>
        The previous lecture covered the basics of 2x2 linear systems.

        It is possible for a linear system to have no solutions at all
        or to have infinitely many solutions.
        In this lecture we will study these slightly more complicated cases
        and introduce the concept of determinant.

            It is easy to distinguish the case of having unique solution
            and the two other cases (infinitely many solutions or no solutions at all).

                One thing that can help us to determine if a
                linear system has a unique solution is
                <em>"determinant"</em>.

    <h3>Sidenote: the notation</h3>

            <p>
                Determinant is an important tool in mathematics.
                We will use it in several areas in linear algebra.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the linear system
                \begin{align*}
                    a x + b y &= f_1 \\
                    c x + d y &= f_2 
                \end{align*}
                in the unknowns $x$ and $y$,
                we may use the notation
                \[
                \left|
                \begin{smallmatrix}
                a & b \\
                c & d
                \end{smallmatrix}
                \right|
                \; = \;
                ad - bc
                \]
                for the determinant.

        <div class="col">
            <p class="fragment">
                Even though this notation looks like the absolute value notation,
                we are <b>not</b> implying it is nonnegative.
                It is certainly possible for a determinant to be negative.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
                We also use the notation

                    \begin{bmatrix}

                    ad - bc
                \]
                for the determinant.
                <span class="lowlight">
                    This notation will make more sense
                    once we study this in the context of matrices.

                It is easy to see the linear system
                \begin{align*}
                    a x + b y &= f_1 \\
                    \color{red}{0} x + \color{red}{0} y &= f_2

                either has no solution at all
                or has infinitely many solution.

                Of course, the same applies if the linear system
                is of the form
                \begin{align*}
                    \color{red}{0} x + \color{red}{0} y &= f_1 \\

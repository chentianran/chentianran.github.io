    <h3>Series</h3>
    <p>
        Today, we aim to gain a clear understanding of "series".

        <li>What it is?</li>
        <li>How to make sense of this concept?</li>

        <li>How to evaluate a series?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="1-2.mp3"></p>
        But before that, we have to review the concept of infinite sequence.
    </p>

    <h3>Review: Sequences</h3>

    <p>
        A <b>sequence</b> is simply a (possibly infinite) 
        <em>ordered</em> the list of numbers.
        We are mainly interested in sequence of real numbers.
        E.g., $1,2,3,4,\dots$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="2-2.mp3">
        We use notations $( a_n )_{n=1}^\infty$,
        or simply $( a_n )$ (or $\{ a_n \}$)
        together with the formula for each $a_n$.
        (Not to be confused with sets)
    </p>
    <!-- Of course, there is no significance to the choice of the symbol $a$,
    the index $n$, and the starting index 1.
    You could use any symbol and any index you want
    and start from anywhere. -->
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="2-3.mp3">
        For example, the sequence of all positive odd numbers
        can be represent by the sequence $( b_k )_{k=0}^{\infty}$ given by
        \[ b_k = 2k + 1. \]
    </p>
</section>
<section data-audio-src="3-1.mp3">
    <h3>Sequence as functions</h3>
    <p>
        Alternatively, we also consider sequences as 
        <em>functions that maps integers to real numbers</em>.
        E.g., the function
        \[
            f(n) = 2n + 1,
        \]
        when restricted to the domain of nonnegative integers,
        also produce the sequence of odd numbers.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="3-2.mp3">
        In general, the sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$
        is equivalent to the function
        \[
            f(n) = a_n
        \]
        that is defined on the set of natural numbers.
    </p>
</section>
<section data-audio-src="4-1.mp3">
    <h3>Limits of sequences</h3>
    <p>
        The most important operation is computing limits of sequences.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p><b>Definition.</b>
            We say $L$ is the <b>limit</b> of a sequence $(a_n)$
            (or  $(a_n)$ <b>converges to</b> $L$)
            if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$
            such that 
            \begin{align*}
                n &\ge N
                &&\text{implies} &
                |a_n - L | &< \epsilon.
            \end{align*}
            In this case, we say the sequence $(a_n)$ is <b>convergent</b>.
            Otherwise, we say the sequence is <b>divergent</b>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="4-2.mp3">
        The skill and intuitions about limits of functions you acquired still work here
        (e.g. the squeeze/sandwich theorem).
    </p>
</section>
<section data-audio-src="5-1.mp3">
    <h3>Series</h3>

    <p>
        A series is a "formal" sum of <em>infinitely</em> many objects.
        <!-- In particular, it can be consider as a sum of an infinite sequence. -->
        <!-- Here, ``formal'' means -->
        <!-- ``there is no guarantee that it actually makes sense''. -->
        For the series with the terms $a_1,a_2,\dots$, we use both notations
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + \cdots
        \]
        <!-- Again, there is no significance to the symbols $a$ and $k$ -->
        <!-- or the starting index $k=1$. -->
        <!-- We could use any symbols we like and start from any where we like. -->
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="5-2.mp3">
        For example, the series
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^k} =
            \frac{1}{2} + 
            \frac{1}{4} + 
            \frac{1}{8} + 
            \frac{1}{16} + 
            \cdots
        \]
        is an infinite sum of all positive integral powers of $\frac{1}{2}$.
    </p>

<section data-audio-src="6-1.mp3">
    <h3>Does it make sense?</h3>

    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="6-2.mp3">
        We should not take the concept of infinite sum for granted.
    </p>
    <!-- For one thing, it may not even make sense: -->
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="6-3.mp3">
        Consider  the series
        \[ 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + \cdots \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="6-4.mp3">
        We can group the consecutive terms and get
        \[
            [1 + (-1)] + [1 + (-1)] + [1 + (-1)] + \cdots
            =
            0 + 0 + 0 + \cdots
        \]
        which must be 0 under any reasonable interpretation.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="6-5.mp3">
        However, the same series can be grouped in a different way:
        \[
            1 + [(-1) + 1] + [(-1) + 1] + \cdots
            =
            1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots
        \]
        which appears to be 1.
        This does not make sense!
    </p>
</section>
<section data-audio-src="7-1.mp3">
    <h3>Shouldn't infinite sum just be infinity?</h3>
    <p>
        If we add up infinitely many terms together,
        shouldn't we just get $\infty$?
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="7-2.mp3">
        Consider the series
        \begin{align*} 
            1 + 1 + 1 &+ \cdots
            &&\text{or} &
            1 + 2 + 3 &+ \cdots
        \end{align*}
        There is no reason to think they can add up to any
        <em>finite</em> value.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="7-3.mp3">
        But the series
        \[
            \frac{1}{2} +
            \frac{1}{4} +
            \frac{1}{8} +
            \frac{1}{16} +
            \cdots
        \]
        will indeed produce a finite value.
        Can you see what should that value be?
    </p>

    <h3>Convergence property</h3>

    To distinguish the kind of series that actually make sense 
    and add up to finite value from the rest,
    we use the concept of "partial sums".

    <div class="theorem fragment">
        <p>
            For a series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$,
            we define its <b>$n$-th partial sum</b> to be
            $ S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k $,
            i.e., the sum of the first $n$ terms.
            If
            \[
                L = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n a_k
            \]
            exists (and finite),
            then this series <b>converges to</b> $L$ (is <b>convergent</b>).
            Otherwise, this series <b>diverges</b>.
            (is <b>divergent</b>).
        </p>
    </div>

    <p class="fragment">
        The "partial sum" is essentially a running total 
        as we go through the terms in a series one by one.
        The series converge if this running total converge.
    </p>

    <h3>Case study: Geometric series</h3>

    <div class="theorem"><p>
        A <b>geometric series</b> is a series of the form
        \[
            a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots =
            \sum_{k=0}^\infty a r^k
        \]
        for some real numbers
        $a \ne 0$ and $|r| \ne 0, 1$.
    </p></div>

    <p class="fragment">
        This series show up in many area of mathematics.
        One early appearance is in
        Archimedes' solution to the problem of area bounded by a parabola.
    </p>

    <div class="fragment">

            <li>Evaluate the series if it is convergent</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</section>
<section>
    <p><b>Solution.</b>
        We will start with $n$-th partial sum $S_n$ and $r$ times $S_n$
        \begin{align*}
            S_n &= a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} \\
            rS_n &= \hspace{3.6ex} ar + ar^2 + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} + ar^n.
        \end{align*}
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        The two have many common terms, so
        <!-- So in the difference $S_n - rS_n$, most of the terms will cancel: -->
        \[
            S_n - rS_n = a - ar^n = a (1-r^n), 
            \quad\text{i.e.,}\quad
            (1 - r)S_n = a(1 - r^n).
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Since we assumed $r \ne 1$.
        Therefore,
        \begin{align*}
            S_n &= \frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1-r}, &
            &\text{and} &
            \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n 
            &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1-r}
            % &= \frac{a(1 - \lim_{n \to \infty}(r^n))}{1-r}
            = \frac{a}{1-r}
        \end{align*}
        <em>if and only if</em> $|r| < 1$.
        Otherwise the limit does not exist.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem fragment"><p>
        The geometric series
        $a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots$
        converges to $\frac{a}{1-r}$

    <h3>Case study: Telescoping series</h3>

    <p><b>Problem.</b>
        Consider the series
        $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k(k+1)}$.
        Determine its convergence property
        and evaluate this series if it converges.
    </p>
    <p><b>Solution.</b>
        A useful observation is that,
        via <em>partial fraction decomposition</em>,
        we can see $\frac{1}{k(k+1)} = \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1}$.
        With this, the partial sum becomes
        \begin{align*}
            &\sum_{k=1}^{n} \left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1} \right) \\
            &= \left[ \left( \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} \right) + \cdots+ \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) \right]\\
            &= \left[ \frac{1}{1} + \left( - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} \right) + \cdots+ \left( -\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n} \right) - \frac{1}{n+1} \right]\\
            &= \left[ \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right]
        \end{align*}
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>
        We have computed that the partial sum is
        \[
            S_n = 1 - \frac{1}{n+1}
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        So
        \[
            \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left[ \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right]
            = 1 - \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n+1} 
            = 1
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Therefore, we can conclude that the series 
        $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k(k+1)}$ converges to 1.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Such a series is called a <b>telescoping series</b> because
        its partial sum collapse due to cancellation of 
        consecutive terms leaving only a few terms.
    </p>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>In general, the idea is to</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decompose each term in to several terms;</li>
            <li>Regroup and cancel some of the terms;</li>
            <li>Reduce the partial sum into just a finite number of terms.</li>

    <h3>Case study: Grandi's</h3>
    <p>
        We come back to the series
        \[
            \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k = 1 + (-1) +1 + (-1) + \cdots.
        \]
        Is it convergent? Is it meaningful to talk about its value?
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        \[
            S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k =
            \begin{cases}
                0 & \text{if $n$ is even} \\
                1 & \text{if $n$ is odd}
            \end{cases}
            \quad\text{so}
            \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n 
            \text{ does not exist}.
        \]
    </p>

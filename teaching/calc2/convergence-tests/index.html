    <h3>Tests for convergence/divergence</h3>
    <p>
    We learned how to determine if a series converges
    by computing limits of partial sums.
    Unfortunately, such direct computation can be quite difficult in many cases.
    In those case, we often prefer to indirect convergence/divergence tests
    which we will outline in the following.
    <!-- {\footnotesize\color{gray}
        (These tests are theorems established based on the definition we saw,
        and they do not give any new meaning to the words convergence or divergence.)

    <h3>Divergence test / $n$-th term test</h3>
    <div class="theorem">
    <p>
        If $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k \ne 0$ (or does not exist),
        then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ diverges.
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        This is a fairly straightforward consequence of how we defined convergence/divergence
        in terms of the limit of the partial sums.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It is super important to understand that 
    the converse of the above statement is not true:
    Having $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k = 0$ does <b>not</b> tell us 
    that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ converges (e.g., the Harmonic series).
    </p>

    <p><b>Problem.</b>
        Determine if $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \cos( 1 / k )$ converges/diverges.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        <b>Solution.</b>
        We can see that, since $\cos$ is a continuous function,
        \[
            \lim_{k \to \infty} \cos( 1 / k )
            = \cos (\lim_{k \to \infty} 1 / k )
            = \cos (0)
            = 1.
        \]
        Therefore, by the divergence test,
        we can conclude that this series diverge.

    <h3>Integral test</h3>
    <p>
        This test turns the problem of determining the convergence property of a series
        into the problem of determining the convergence property of an improper integral
        for which we have more advanced tools.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p>
            If $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ is a series
            and $f$ is a <em>continuous and decreasing</em> function
            such that $f(k) = a_k > 0$ for any positive integer $k$,
            then
            \[
                \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k
                \quad\text{and}\quad
                \int_1^\infty f(x) dx
                \quad\text{both converge or both diverge}.
            \]
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        It is important to understand that the integral test
        is tests for convergence.
        In general, it cannot tell you if what value a series converges to.

    <p><b>Problem.</b>
        Determine if $\sum_{k=1}^\infty 3 / \sqrt{2k + 4}$
        is convergent or divergent.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        <b>Solution.</b>
        To determine if this series is convergent using integral test,
        we can compute the improper integral
        \[
            \int_1^\infty \frac{3}{ \sqrt{2x + 4} } dx
            = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_1^t \frac{3}{ \sqrt{2x + 4} } dx
            = \lim_{t \to \infty} \left. 3 \sqrt{2x+4} \, \right|_1^t
        \]
        which diverges (goes to $\infty$).
        By the integral test,
        we can conclude that the series 
        $\sum_{k=1}^\infty 3 / \sqrt{2k + 4}$
        is also divergent.
    </p>

<section>
    <p><b>Problem.</b>
        For a positive real number $p \ne 1$,
        determine if the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty 1 / k^p$ 
        is convergent or divergent.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        <b>Solution.</b>
        We can compute the improper integral
        \[
            \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{ x^p } dx
            = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{ x^p } dx
            = \lim_{t \to \infty} \left. \frac{x^{1-p}}{ (1-p) } \right|_1^t
            = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{t^{1-p}}{ (1-p) }  - \frac{1}{1-p}
        \]
        which converge if $p > 1$
        and   diverge  if $p < 1$.
        By the integral test,
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty 1 / k^p
            \quad
            \begin{cases}
                \text{converge if} & p > 1 \\
                \text{diverge  if} & p < 1
            \end{cases}
        \]

    <h3>$p$-series</h3>
    <p>
        The solution to the last problem is particularly useful
        and thus deserves its own test.
        Series of the form $\sum_{k=1}^\infty 1 / k^p$ for some real number $p$
        appear very frequently and earned the nickname $p$<b>-series</b>.
    </p>
    <!-- {\footnotesize\color{gray}
        (No one will understand you 
        if you call the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty 1 / k^2$ a ``2-series''.
        Instead, we call that a $p$-series with $p=2$.)
    } -->

    <div class="theorem">
        <p>
            \[
                \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p}

                \begin{cases}

        Note that the special case of $p=1$ is exactly the

    <h3>It's all about the tail</h3>
    <p>
        The tests stated above are about series of the form $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$.
        However, it is important to understand that the starting index does not matter.
        Indeed, one could ignore a finite number of terms.
    </p>
        <!-- For example, you can ignore the first one billion terms of a series,
        and they will not change how you determine its convergence property. -->
    <div class="theorem">
        <p>
            For any positive integer $N$, the two series

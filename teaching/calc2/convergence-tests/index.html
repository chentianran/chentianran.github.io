    <h3>Tests for convergence/divergence</h3>
    <p>
    We learned how to determine if a series converges
    by computing limits of partial sums.
    Unfortunately, such direct computation can be quite difficult in many cases.
    In those case, we often prefer to use indirect convergence/divergence tests
    which we will outline in the following.

        (These tests are theorems established based on the definition we saw,
        and they do not give any new meaning to the words convergence or divergence.)

    <h3>Divergence test / $n$-th term test</h3>
    <div class="theorem">
    <p>
        If $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k \ne 0$ (or does not exist),
        then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ diverges.
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        This is a fairly straightforward consequence of how we defined convergence/divergence
        in terms of the limit of the partial sums.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="2-2.mp3">
        It is super important to understand that 
        the converse of the above statement is not true:
        Having $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k = 0$ does <b>not</b> tell us 
        that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ converges 
        (e.g., the Harmonic series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty 1 / k$).

    <h3>Divergence test: An example</h3>

    <p><b>Problem.</b>
        Determine if $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \cos( 1 / k )$ converges/diverges.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="3-2.mp3">
        <b>Solution.</b>
        We can see that, since $\cos$ is a continuous function,
        \[
            \lim_{k \to \infty} \cos( 1 / k )
            = \cos \left( \lim_{k \to \infty} 1 / k \right)
            = \cos (0)
            = 1.
        \]
        Therefore, by the divergence test,
        we can conclude that this series diverge. 
    </p>

<section data-audio-src="4-1.mp3">
    <h3>Divergence test: An nonexample</h3>

    <p>
        What about the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \sin( 1 / k )$ ?
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>This is an example in which the divergence test <b>tells us nothing</b>.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to understand that even though 
        \[
            \lim_{k \to \infty} \sin \left( \frac{1}{k} \right)
            = \sin \left( \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{k} \right)
            = \sin (0)
            = 0,
        \]
        we cannot conclude that the series is therefore convergent
        (the divergent test can help us to confirm a series is divergent,
        it cannot, however, tell us if a series is convergent.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="4-2.mp3">
        In other words, having the limit of the terms be zero
        is a <em>necessary</em> condition for convergence,
        but that is not an <em>sufficient</em> condition.

    <h3>Integral test</h3>
    <p>
        This test turns the problem of determining the convergence property of a series
        into the problem of determining the convergence property of an improper integral
        for which we have more advanced tools.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem fragment" data-audio-src="5-2.mp3">
        <p>
            If $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ is a series
            and $f$ is a <em>continuous and decreasing</em> function
            such that $f(k) = a_k > 0$ for any positive integer $k$,
            then
            \[
                \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k
                \quad\text{and}\quad
                \int_1^\infty f(x) dx
                \quad\text{both converge or both diverge}.
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to understand that the integral test
            is tests for convergence.
            In general, it cannot tell you which value a series converges to.

    <p><b>Problem.</b>
        Determine if $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{3}{\sqrt{2k + 4}}$
        is convergent or divergent.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="6-2.mp3">
        <b>Solution.</b>
        To determine if this series is convergent using integral test,
        we can compute the improper integral
        \[
            \int_1^\infty \frac{3}{ \sqrt{2x + 4} } dx
            = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_1^t \frac{3}{ \sqrt{2x + 4} } dx
            = \lim_{t \to \infty} \left. 3 \sqrt{2x+4} \, \right|_1^t
        \]
        which diverges (goes to $\infty$).
        By the integral test,
        we can conclude that the series 
        $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{3}{\sqrt{2k + 4}}$
        is also divergent.

    <p><b>Problem.</b>
        For a positive real number $p \ne 1$,
        determine if the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty 1 / k^p$

    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="7-2.mp3">
        <b>Solution.</b>
        We can compute the improper integral
        $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{ x^p } dx$, which turns into
        \[
            \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{ x^p } dx
            = \lim_{t \to \infty} \left. \frac{x^{1-p}}{ (1-p) } \right|_1^t
            = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{t^{1-p}}{ (1-p) }  - \frac{1}{1-p}
        \]
        which converge if $p > 1$
        and   diverge  if $p < 1$.
        By the integral test,
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p}

        The solution to the last problem is particularly useful

    <h3>It's all about the tail</h3>

        The tests stated above are about series of the form $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$.
        However, it is important to understand that the starting index does not matter.
        Indeed, one could ignore a finite number of terms.

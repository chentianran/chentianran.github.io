# {{ page.title }}

Polar coordinate system is a planar (2-dimensional) coordinate system in which
each point on a plane is represented by its distance from a reference point
(the _pole_ or _origin_) and an angle from a reference direction (the _polar axis_).

In the demonstration below, move your mouse to see how points on the plane
are represented in the polar coordinate system.

Just like the in the Cartesian system, each point on the plane is represented
by a pair of numbers in the polar coordinate system.
But instead of using $$(x,y)$$, the polar coordinate system uses $$(r,\theta)$$
where $$r$$ represents the distance between this point and the pole
while $$\theta$$ angle between the reference direction and the ray formed by
the pole and this point.

The polar coordinates r and Ï• can be converted to the Cartesian coordinates
x and y by using the trigonometric functions:

\\[
  \begin{align\*}
    x &= r \cos(\theta) \\
    y &= r \sin(\theta)
  \end{align\*}
\\]

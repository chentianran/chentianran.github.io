    <h3>Substitution for definite integrals</h3>
    <p>
        We already learned how to use the method of substitution to turn
        seemingly complicated indefinite integrals into 
        simpler ones we can actually compute.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        For example, we learned how to compute integrals like these
        \[
            \int e^{x^2} \, 2x \, dx,
            \quad\quad\quad
            \int \frac{3x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} dx,
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        A natural question to ask is: What about definite integral like
        \[
            \int_0^1 \frac{3x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} dx \, ?
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Thanks to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
        definite integrals can be computed through indefinite integrals,
        so the same applies,
        <em>as long as we also perform the same transformation to the limits of integration</em>.

    <h3>A simple example</h3>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col">
            <div class="example">
                Compute the definite integral 
                \[\int_0^2 (x-1)^5 dx.\]
            </div>
            <p class="fragment">
                <b>Solution.</b>
                Applying a substitution,
                we let $u = x-1$ then $du = dx$. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <span class="fragment highlight">
                We also have to pay attention to the limits of integration,
                because "$\int_0^2$" means from $x=0$ to $x=2$.
                We have to convert those to the equivalent boundary in terms of $u$.
            </span>
            <p class="fragment">
                When $x=0$, $u=-1$.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
                When $x=2$, $u=1$.
            </p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        Therefore, 
        \[
            \int_0^2 (x-1)^5 dx
            = \int_{-1}^{1} u^5 du 
            = \left[ \frac{u^6}{6} \right]_{-1}^1 
            = \frac{1^6}{6} - \frac{(-1)^6}{6}
            = \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = 0.
        \]

    <h3>An alternative</h3>
    <p>
        In certain situations, 
        we may not want to compute the new limits of integration 
        (e.g., the computation maybe cumbersome or inexact).
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col">
            <div class="example">
                Compute
                \[
                    \int_1^2 [\sin(x)]^2 \cos(x) \, dx.
                \]
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p class="fragment">
                Applying a substitution,
                we let $\color{red}{u = \sin(x)}$, 
                then $\color{blue}{du = \cos(x) dx}$.
                <span class="fragment">
                    So $\int [\color{red}{\sin(x)}]^2 \color{blue}{\cos(x) dx} =
                    \int \color{red}{u}^2 \color{blue}{du}$.
                </span>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        So the original integral can be turned into 
        \[ 
            \int_\square^\square u^2 du
            = \left[\frac{1}{3} u^3 \right]_\square^\square
            = \left[\frac{1}{3} (\sin x)^3 \right]_1^2
            = \frac{\sin^3(2) - \sin^3(1)}{3}.
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Here, we use "$\square$" to indicate that 
        we <em>should</em> compute the new limits of integration 
        with respect to the new variable $u$,
        but we are just <em>don't want do that</em>.
        Instead, we will switch back to $x$ in the next step,
        thus $\square$'s are placeholders for the 
        limits of integration in the intermediate steps.

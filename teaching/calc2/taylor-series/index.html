    <h3>Taylor and Maclaurin series</h3>
    <p>
        The discussion in the previous lecture shows that 
        within its interval of convergence,
        a power series represents a function 
        (a very nice function as far as doing calculus is concerned).
        It is then reasonable to ask:
        <em>
            Given a function, can we find a power series that represents the function?
            This is the main question we want to answer in this lecture.

    <!-- <p>Polynomial approximations of $y=e^x$ near $x=0$:</p> -->
    <p>
        Best linear (1st degree) approximation of $y=e^x$ near $x=0$ is
        \[
            y = 1 + x
        \]
        It has the same function value and derivative at $x=0$
        as $y=e^x$.

    <p class="fragment">
        Best quadratic (2nd degree) approximation
        \[
            y = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2}

        It has the same function value, same derivative,
        and same second derivative at $x=0$ as the original function $y=e^x$

    <p class="fragment">
        Best cubic (3rd degree) approximation

        We can continue this pattern and reach the formula
        \[
            e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24}

    <h3>Taylor and Maclaurin series</h3>
    <p>
    <div class="theorem"><p>
        <b>Definition.</b>
        Let $f$ be a function whose derivatives of all orders are defined
        (and finite) in an open interval around $x=a$.
        The <b>Taylor series</b> of the function $f$ (centered) at $x=a$ is the series
        \[
            \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!} \, (x-a)^k
            = f(a) + f'(a) (x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2} (x-a)^2 + \cdots
        \]
    </p></div>
    <!-- <p>
        Here $f^{(k)}$ denotes the $k$-th derivative of $f$,
        and $k!$ denotes the factorial of $k$.
    </p> -->
    <p class="fragment">
        The special case of Taylor series of a function $f$ centered at $x=0$
        is called the <b>Maclaurin series</b> of $f$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Recall that the notation $f^{(k)}$ denotes the $k$-th derivative of
        the function $f$.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>
        Let's apply the formula of Taylor series 
        \[
            f(a) + 
            f'(a) (x-a) + 
            \frac{f'' (a)}{2} (x-a)^2 + 
            \frac{f'''(a)}{6} (x-a)^3 + \cdots
        \]
        to the function $f(x) = e^x$, centered at $x=0$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        To do that, we need to compute <em>all</em>
        derivatives of $f(x) = e^x$.
        Fortunately, this is easy to do for this particular function since
        \[
            f^{(k)} (x) = \frac{d^k}{dx^k} (e^x) = e^x
            \quad \text{and} \quad e^0 = 1,
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        which means $f^{(k)}(0) = 1$ for any $k$ in this case.
        Therefore
        \[
            e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24}
            + \cdots + \frac{x^k}{k!} + \cdots
        \]
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Another example</h3>
    <p>
        Let's apply the formula 
        $ f(a) + f'(a) (x-a) + \frac{f'' (a)}{2} (x-a)^2 + \cdots$
        to the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, centered at $x=1$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Again, to do this, we will need to compute <em>all</em>
        the derivatives of the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}$
        via repeated applications of the "power rule".
    </p>
    <div class="aligned">
        <p class="fragment">
            $f'(x) = - x^{-2}$
        </p>
        <p class="fragment">
            $f''(x) = -(-2) x^{-3} = 2x^{-3}$
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="aligned">
        <p class="fragment">
            $f'''(x) = (-3) 2 x^{-4} = -6x^{-4}$
        </p>
        <p class="fragment">
            $f^{(4)}(x) = (-4)(-6)x^{-5} = 24x^{-5}$
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>
            After computing a few of these,
            we can see that
        </p>
        <div class="aligned">
            <p>$f^{(k)}(x) = (-1)^k \, k! \, x^{-k-1}$</p>
            <!-- <p>and therefore,</p> -->
            <p class="fragment">$f^{(k)}(1) = (-1)^k \, k!$ </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>
            The Taylor series of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ centered at $x=1$ is therefore
        </p>
        <div class="equation">
            <p>$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(k)}(1)}{k!} (x-1)^k$</p>
            <p class="fragment">$= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k \, k!}{k!} (x-1)^k$ </p>

    <h3>What's the point?</h3>

    <p>
        The importance of Taylor series lies in its unique ability to represent
        a function using information from a single point.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem fragment"><p>
        <b>Theorem.</b>
        Let $f$ be a function defined on an open interval containing $x=a$.
        If there is a power series centered at $x=a$ that converges to $f$
        on this interval, then this series must be the Taylor series of $f$ at $x=a$.
    </p></div>
    <p class="fragment">
        The "if" part of the above theorem may not always hold.
        There are functions that does not agree with any power series on an open interval.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment"><b>Exercise.</b>
        Compute the Taylor series of the following functions of $x$ centered at $x=0$,
        and see if the function agrees with the series.
        \begin{align*}
            & e^x &
            & \sin(x) &
            & \cos(x) &
            & \sinh(x) &
            & \ln(1+x) &
            & \frac{1}{1-x}
        \end{align*}
    </p>

    <h3>Taylor Polynomials</h3>
    <p>
        In many applications, a full Taylor series is often not necessary,
        and a partial sum may be sufficient.
        Such a partial sum is called a <b>Taylor polynomial</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        For examples, for a function $f(x)$,
        \begin{align*}
            p_0(x) &= f(a) \\
            p_1(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) \\
            p_2(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2} (x-a)^2 \\
            p_3(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2} (x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{6} (x-a)^3
        \end{align*}
        are Taylor polynomials for $f$ at $a$ of degree 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Taylor polynomial of a function centered at 0
        is a <b>Maclaurin polynomial</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Revisiting $e^x$</h3>
    <p>
        As we saw earlier,
        we can approximate the function $f(x) = e^x$
        using polynomials near $x=0$.
        Those are indeed Taylor polynomials.

    <h3>Taylor Remainder Theorem</h3>
    <p>
        Taylor polynomials are finite approximations of Taylor series.
        Whether or not this approximation is good depends on the function itself,
        and the following theorem quantifies how good this approximation can be.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem fragment"><p>
        <b>Taylor's Remainder Theorem.</b>
        For a function $f$ that is at least $n+1$ times differentiable 
        on an open interval that contains $a$,
        Let $p_n$ be its degree $n$ Taylor polynomial.
        Then for any $x$ in this interval, 
        there exists a real number $c$ between $a$ and $x$ such that
        \[
            f(x) - p_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)} (c)}{(n+1)!} (x - a)^{n+1}.
        \]
    </p></div>
    <p class="fragment">
        Here $R_n(x) = f(x) - p_n(x)$ is called the <b>$n$-th remainder</b>.
        The above theorem states that if we can control the magitude of the
        $n+1$ order derivative of $f$, we can control the remainder $R_n$.

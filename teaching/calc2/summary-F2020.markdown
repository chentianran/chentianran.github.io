## Your typical week

* You will watch several videos listed on the Blackboard course page
  (don't worry, they are very short).
  It is up to you when to watch them,
  but obviously the earlier the better.
  In particular, __you should watch these videos before you meet with me__.
* You will read our textbook, then take reading tests
  (usually there are 2 each week).
* You will meet with me...
  * either in in-person meetings (in-person problem sessions)...
  * or in one-on-one Zoom meetings
  We will __not__ do lectures in these meetings,
  instead I will answer your questions or have other discussions.
  You will complete worksheets in these meetings (see below).
* You will take a survey.
* You will complete a homework assignment or a concept test.

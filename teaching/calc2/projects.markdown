## Infinite series

### [A] Leibniz series
(5pt) Compute or estimate the value of the convergent infinite series
<p>
\[ \sum_{k=1} (-1)^{k-1} \frac{4}{k} \]
</p>
(You should be able to get a good estimate by adding a large number of terms)

### [B] Exponential function
(5pt) We have learned that the function $$e^x$$ has a Taylor series expansion
of the form
<p>
\[ \sum_{k=0} \frac{x^k}{k!}. \]
</p>
Use the "ratio test" or "root test", to show this series converges.

## Trajectory of a basket ball

(5pt) For this part, let us assume that there is no air resistance.
 (i.e., we will only consider the influence of gravitational pull).
 Compute the trajectory of a basket ball begin thrown with initial
 horizontal and vertical velocity of $$v_x$$ and $$v_y$$ respectively
 and from a height of 2 meters.
 That is, solve the system of differential equations
 <p>
 \[
  \begin{cases}
  \ddot{x}(t) = 0 \\
  \ddot{y}(t) = -9.8
  \end{cases}
 </p>
 using the initial conditions
 <p>
 \begin{cases}
  x(0) = 0 \\
  y(0) = 2 \\
  \dot{x}(0) = v_x \\
  \dot{y}(0) = v_y.
 \end{cases}
 </p>
 Note that here $$-9.8m/s^2$$ is the gravitational acceleration.
 For simplicity, we are taking the mass of the basket ball to be 1000 grams
 which is a pretty close approximation
 (NBA basket balls are usually around 600~800 grams).

(++5pt) Suppose a player stands 5 meters from the hoop (horizontal distance),
which is just outside the free throw line, and throws the ball from a height
of 2 meters (vertical height).
The standard NBA hoop is about 3 meters from the floor.
Calculate the vertical and horizontal velocity required to make such a free throw.

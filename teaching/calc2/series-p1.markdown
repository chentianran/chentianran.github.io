# Harmonic series

Harmonic series is an infinite series of the form
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$$.
Its name derives from the concept of harmonics (overtones) in music:
the wavelengths of the overtones of a vibrating string are
$$\frac{1}{2}$$, $$\frac{1}{3}$$, $$\frac{1}{4}$$, etc.,
of the string's length.
The demo below shows how the partial sum $$S$$ grows
as $$n \to \infty$$.
Can you tell if it converges to a number?

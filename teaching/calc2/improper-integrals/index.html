        An important generalization of definite integral
        (the Riemann integral) which we have learned in basic calculus
        is the special kind of integral that involves infinity.
        As strange as it may sound, it actually has broad applications
        in real-world problems.

    <h3>The "wrong" kind of integrals</h3>
    <p>
        By now, we should have a solid understanding of definite integrals
        $\int_a^b f(x) dx$.
        We defined this rigorously via Riemann sum.
        The focus of today is the "wrong" kind of integrals like
        \[
            \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x} dx \quad
            \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} dx \quad
            \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} dx \quad
            \int_{0}^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} dx
        \]
        It is not even clear they make any sense at all.
        Our goal is to make sense of them and determine their value rigorously.

            Hello everyone!
            Welcome back to another calculus lesson!
            The topic today is improper integrals:
            It's all about doing integrals, but doing it wrong.
            Yet, we will develop a mathematical solution that will help us
            to make sense of these wrong kind of integrals.
        </p>
        <p>
            By now, you should have a solid understanding of definite integrals
            of the form $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ which gives us the total signed area
            bounded by the graph of the function $y=f(x)$ and the $x$-axis
            from $x = a$ to $x=b$.
            We defined this rigorously via Riemann sum (this is Riemann integral).
            The focus of today's discussion is the ``wrong'' kind of integrals like
            these ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the way, can you see what's wrong with the last one?
            Pay close attention to where the integral starts.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not even clear they make any sense at all.
            Think about it,
            does it really make sense to compute the area of an infinitely long shape?
            Or infinitely tall shape?
            Our goal is to make sense of this type of integrals
            and determine their values rigorously.
        </p>
        <p>
            Integrals of this kind are quite common in applications.
            Probably more than you think.
            For example, in probability theory, continuous probability distributions
            and expected values are defined in terms of integrals to infinity.
            In control theory or signal processing, the Laplace transform is
            also defined in terms of such integrals to infinity.

    <h3>Integration over infinite intervals</h3>
    <p>
        The first kind of integrals we are going to look at 
        involve interval that are infinitely long.
        E.g.
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                &\int_a^{\infty} f(x) dx, &
                &\int_{-\infty}^b f(x) dx, &
                &\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        They are known as <b>improper integrals</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="audio/2-2.mp3">
        These integrals cannot be understood from the view point of Riemann sums:
        the intervals are infinitely long.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="audio/2-3.mp3">
        The right approach is to define them in terms of limits.
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>
            The first kind of integrals we are going to look at is the kind 
            in which the interval of integration is infinitely long,
            like these ones.
            They are integrals from somewhere to infinity,
            or from negative infinity to somewhere,
            or from negative infinity to positive infinity,
            which is essentially over the entire real line.
        </p>
        <p>
            Integrals of these forms
            are known as improper integrals.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to see that these integrals
            cannot be understood from the view point of Riemann sums.
            Can you see why?
            So to make sense of these,
            we will need something else.
            In typical calculus fashion,
            the right approach is to define them in terms of limits.

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <div class="definition">
        <b>(Improper integral)</b>
        For a <em>continuous</em> function $f(x)$, 
        we define
        \[
            \int_a^{\infty} f(x) dx = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_a^t f(x) dx
        \]
        if the limit exists (and finite), 
        in which case we say the improper integral <b class="term">converges</b>
        (or is <b class="term">convergent</b>).
        Otherwise, we say it <b class="term">diverges</b>
        (or is <b class="term">divergent</b>).
    </div>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>
            For a continuous function $f(x)$, we define
            the integral from $a$ to infinity 
            as the limit of of the integral from $a$ to $t$
            as $t$ goes to infinity,
            IF this limit exists.
            And that's a big IF, of course.
            As you probably know by now,
            there are many situations in which limits can fail to exist.
            So that's a very big IF.
            But IF the limit does exist,
            we say the improper integral CONVERGES
            (or the integral is CONVERGENT).
            Otherwise, we say it <b>diverges</b>
            (or is <b>divergent</b>).
        </p>
        <p>
            A side note here: 
            For consistency, we do not consider $\infty$ or $-\infty$
            to be valid limits in this part of the discussion.
            Since infinity is not a real number.
            We will, however, discuss more the general concept of ``infinite limits'' 
            in later discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see this is really the classic calculus solution
            to everything problem we have:
            IF we cannot know what happens AT infinity,
            we take the limit as we go toward infinity.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we understand that,
            we can certainly go the other direction.
            We can define the integral from negative infinity to $b$
            to be the limit of the integral from $t$ to $b$
            as $t$ goes to negative infinity,
            IF this limit exists.
            Again, if the limit exists,
            we say the improper integral converges.
            Otherwise, we say the it diverges.

    \subsection*{Improper integrals: integrating over discontinuities}

    The second kind of improper integrals involves discontinuities
    of the integrand.
    For example, even though $\int_0^1 1 / \sqrt{x} \, dx$ 
    only involves a finite interval,
    the integrand $1 / \sqrt{x}$ ``goes to infinity'' as $x \to 0$
    and hence not defined (or finite) over the entire interval $[0,1]$.
    It is still meaningful to compute this type of integrals.
    Again, in the typical calculus fashion, ``limits'' is going to
    get us out of this trouble.
    
    \begin{tcolorbox}[boxsep=0pt]
        If $f(x)$ is continuous in $[a,b)$, then
        \[
            \int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{t \to b^-} \int_a^t f(x) dx
            \quad\text{if this limit exists}.
        \]
        If $f(x)$ is continuous in $(a,b]$, then
        \[
            \int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{t \to a^+} \int_t^b f(x) dx.
            \quad\text{if this limit exists}.
        \]
        In both cases, if the limits exist, we say the integral \term{converge}.
        Otherwise we say the integral \term{diverge}.
        \vspace{0.8ex}

        If $f(x)$ is continuous in $[a,c)$ and $(c,b]$, then
        \[
            \int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^c f(x) dx + \int_c^b f(x) dx
        \]
        if both of the integrals on the right hand side converge.

    \begin{problem}
        Compute $\int_0^1 1 / \sqrt{x} \, dx$.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{soln}
        Notice that the integrand $1 / \sqrt{x}$ is continuous on $(0,1]$
        but grows unboundedly as $x \to 0^+$.
        By the definition given above,
        \begin{align*}
            \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx
            &= \lim_{t \to 0+} \int_t^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx
            = \lim_{t \to 0+} [2 \sqrt{x} ]_t^1
            = \lim_{t \to 0+} [2 - 2\sqrt{t} ]
            = 2.
        \end{align*}
    \end{soln}
    \begin{problem}
        For any given rational (or real) number $p>0$, 
        determine if $\int_0^1 1 / x^p \, dx$ is convergent.
    \end{problem}

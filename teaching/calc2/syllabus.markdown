{% include hours.markdown %}

My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

This is the second course in the calculus sequence.
We will discuss more advanced topics in calculus and related areas of mathematics.
In particular, we will cover...

* Deeper subjects involving limits
  - Technical definition of limits
  - Limits of sequences
  - Limits of indeterminate form
* Infinite series
  - Convergence properties
  - Rules for testing Convergence
  - Taylor series expansion of functions
* Important functions
  - Exponential functions
  - Logarithm functions
  - Inverse trigonometric functions
  - Hyperbolic functions
* Simple differential equations
* Describing curves using parametric equations
* Advanced integration techniques
  - Integration by substitution
  - Integration by parts
  - Integration involving inverse trigonometric functions
  - Improper Integrals
* Applications of Integrals
  - Computing arc-length
  - Computing volume
  - Computing center of mass

### Prerequisite

In order to succeed in this class, a solid understanding of basic calculus is necessary.
These prerequisite can be satisfied by MATH-1610
or an appropriate score in the AUM Math Placement Test.

### Textbook

- [Required] _Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (any edition) by Larson & Edwards
  (6th edition ISBN: 978-1285774770)
- [Optional] _Calculus_ by Gilbert Strang (PDF version is _free_!)
    * [One single big PDF file](http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/Strang/Edited/Calculus/Calculus.pdf)
    * [PDF files by chapters](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/)
    * [A few great video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/highlights_of_calculus/big-picture-of-calculus/)

Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from these textbook.

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
According to AUM Mathematics Department Calculator Policy,
students are required to have a graphing calculator
(TI-84 is recommended).
The use of such calculators may be required for certain homework problems
or in-class activities.
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities
are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

### Daily quizzes

There will be a short quiz at the beginning of _every_ class meeting to test
our understanding of the material discussed in the previous meeting.
__No makeup quiz will be offered__.
However, a missing quiz may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of zero.

### Projects
Projects are more complicated mathematical problems that will
guide you to gain deeper understanding of the material we learn in class.
They are a major part of your course grade.

### Final exam
The mandatory final exam will take place in the last day of class.
It constitutes a major part of your course grade.

### Grade composition
Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of quizzes,
the in-class worksheets, projects, and the final exam,
and is calculated according to the following weights.

| Component  | Points |
|------------|--------|
| Quizzes    |  400   |
| Projects   |   40   |
| Final Exam |   60   |

### Grading scale

* A: 90% - 100%
* B: 80% - 89.9%
* C: 70% - 79.9%
* D: 60% - 69.9%
* F: below 60%

### Suggested homework problems
Practice is a crucial component in the learning process.
Certain exercise problems will be assigned in class.
They will not be collected or graded.
However, since all exams are very similar to questions from homework,
doing the homework problems regularly is crucial for our success in this course.

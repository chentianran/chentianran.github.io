# MATH-1620 Fall 2020

* [Course syllabus](syllabus-F2020/)
* [Informal summary for syllabus](summary-F2020/)

<!-- ## How to survive this course

* Read before class
  - Reading is an important component in our learning process.
  - Reading assignment are listed in the course calendar (to be finished before class)
  - Reading questions are also given to provide guidance to your reading
    (Keep them in mind as you read, you don't have to provide definitive answers,
    but you should attempt to answer them as you read)
* Read your quizzes and the solution sheets
  - You should understand why your answers are wrong (or why they are right)
  - If you see the same questions again in the future, will you make the same mistakes?
* Be an active thinker
  - You are not a passive note-taking robot
  - Let's think together!
* Tell yourself that it is okay to not know the correct answer
  - ...well, as long as you are actively trying to figure out the answers
  - the process of the trying to figure out the answer is the important part.
    The only important part! -->

## Additional material

I have created the following interactive demonstrations for certain
difficult concepts one may encounter in this course.

### Infinite series

- [Harmonic series](series-p1/)
- [Hyperharmonic series with p=2](series-p2/)
- [Hyperharmonic series with p=1.01](series-p101/)
- [Alternating harmonic series](series-a1/)
- [Leibniz series](series-leibniz/)

### Parametric curves

- [Basic example: circle](parametric/)

### Coordinate systems

- [Polar coordinate system](polar/)
- [Polar spiral](polar-spiral/)
- [Polar rose](polar-rose/)

### Misc.

* Definition: _A __lecture__ is a process in which information passes
  from the notes of the lecturer into the notes of the student
  without passing through the minds of either._
  Funny, but true.
  But it really shouldn't be.
  Let's make sure our lectures are not like that.

    <h3>Ratio and root tests</h3>
    <p>
        In the previous lecture, we learned the concept of "absolute convergence", 
        which is a stronger type of convergence
        that guarantees many nice properties.
        Based on the observations on geometric series,
        we have two tests that can test for absolute convergence.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Both of these tests can identify series that can be
        approximated sufficiently well by geometric series,
        which we now fully understand.

    <h3>Ratio test</h3>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p>
            Let $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ be a series with $a_k \ne 0$
            and $r = \lim_{k \to \infty} | \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} |$.
        </p>    
        <ul>
            <li>
                If $0 \le r \le 1$, then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ converges <em>absolutely</em>.
            </li>
            <li> 
                If $r > 1$ or is infinite, then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ diverges.
            </li>   
        </ul>
        <p>
            (If $r = 1$, then this test is inconclusive.)
        </p>
    </div>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Root test</h3>
    <p>
        The "root test" works in a slight different way,
        but the two essentially detect the same thing:
        whether or not a series can be approximated by a geometric series sufficiently well.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p>
            Let $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ be a series
            and $r = \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{ | a_k | }$.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> 
                If $0 \le r \le 1$, then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ converges <em>absolutely</em>.
            </li>
            <li> 
                If $r > 1$ or is infinite, then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ diverges.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            (Again, if $r = 1$, then this test is inconclusive.)
        </p>
    </p></div>
    <p>
        Note the structural similarity between the two tests.
        This is expected as the two are designed to detect the same property.

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <p>
        Using ratio and root tests,
        determine which of the following series is/are absolutely convergent

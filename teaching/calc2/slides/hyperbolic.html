        for the standard equilateral hyperbola,

    <h3>Hyperbolic functions</h3>
    <p>
        Hyperbolic functions are mirror images of the ordinary trigonometric functions
        constructed using hyperbola (instead of the unit circle).
        In particular, the "hyperbolic sine" and "hyperbolic cosine" 
        are the coordinate functions for the standard equilateral hyperbola.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        They appear naturally in the context of
        hyperbolic geometry, linear differential equations,
        classical mechanics, and special relativity 
        (among many other topics).
        So they are important tools to understand.

            The <em class="term">unit circle</em> is a circle of radius 1
            centered at the origin.
            It can be expressed as the set of all points $(x,y)$
            on the plane that satisfy
            \[ x^2 + y^2 = 1. \]

        </div>
        <div class="col fragment">
            Ordinary sine and cosine can be understood as
            coordinate functions for the unit circle:
            Every point on a unit circle can be expressed as
            $(x,y)$ with $x = \cos(t)$ and
            $y = \sin(t)$.

    <p class="fragment">
        If we replace the unit circle by the equilateral hyperbola,
        the corresponding coordinate functions we get are the

        A <strong class="term">hyperbola</strong> is a set of points
        whose absolute difference of the distances to two fixed points is a constant.
        The name came from a Greek word that means "excessive"
        from which we also get the English word hyperbole.
        In classical Greek mathematics,
        it is the name of one of the conic sections
        (the other two are the ellipse and the parabola).

    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>
        The two functions $\cosh(t)$ and $\sinh(t)$
        also appear naturally in other context.
        For instance, we can verify that
        \[ \cosh(t) + \sinh(t) = e^{t}. \]
        Indeed $\cosh(t)$ and $\sinh(t)$ are exactly the
        <em>even part</em> and the <em>odd part</em>
        of the exponential function $e^t$.

    <h3>Connections to differential equations</h3>

    <p>
        From this we can see $\cosh$ and $\sinh$
        are solutions to the equation 
        \[ y'' = y, \] 
        which is an equation that
        show up naturally in physics and engineering.
    </p> 
    <p class="fragment lowlight">
        Side note: Indeed, $\cosh$ and $\sinh$ are "linear independent"
        and they form a "fundamental set" of solutions to the
        differential equation $y''=y$.
        Moreover, they satisfies the initial conditions
        \[ y(0) = 1 \quad y'(0) = 0 \]
        and
        \[ y(0) = 0 \quad y'(0) = 1 \]
        respectively.
        These properties make the especially desirable type of solutions
        in physics and engineering.

    <h3>Other hyperbolic functions</h3>

        Just like how you can define other trigonometric functions
        in terms of sine and cosine,
        we can define additional hyperbolic functions
        in terms of hyperbolic sine and cosine.

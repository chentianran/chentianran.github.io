    <h3>Arc-length computation</h3>

        Finding the length of a straight line segment is easy,
        thanks to the Pythagorean Theorem.

        In applications, we often need to compute the length of a curve 
        that are not straight lines.
        In the context of this course, such problems are known as "arc-length' computation.
        This can be done using definite integrals.

        It turns out, as long as the curve can be expressed as the graph of a 
        continuously differentiable function $y = f(x)$ 
        (or $x = g(y)$), we can express the arc-length as a definite integral.

                Here, the <em>length of the segment of a curve</em>
                is simply understood intuitively as the distance between two points
                along a section of a curve.
                Defining this concept rigorously is a much deeper problem
                that you will study in analysis.

        Note that here we require the function $y=f(x)$ 
        to be not only differentiable but also <em>continuously differentiable</em>,
        i.e., its derivative is also continuous on the interval we are considering.
        This is important.
        Without this condition, this framework may fall apart.
    </p>
    <p>
        To see an example,
        what do you think is the arc-length of the segment of the graph of 
        \[
            f(x) =
            \begin{cases}
                \frac{ \sin \left( \frac{1}{x^2} \right) }{x^2} &\text{if } x \ne 0 \\
                0 &\text{otherwise }
            \end{cases}
        \]
        between $x=-1$ and $x=1$?
        Note that this function is continuous 
        but its derivative is not continuous.

    <p>To actually compute the resulting integral, we will have to use trigonometric substitution. Please see earlier

    <p>In the typical calculus fashion, we compute the arc-length by cutting the curve into many many small pieces
        (indeed, infinitely many “infinitesimal” pieces). Consider a small segment of a curve, as shown in this figure
        (dashed line). We approximate segment with a straight line segment (blue solid line) joining two points on the
        curve. If the horizontal and vertical differences are <span class="math inline">$\Delta x$</span> and <span
            class="math inline">$\Delta y$</span> respectively, then by Pythagorean theorem, the length of this
        segment is <span class="math display">\[\Delta s = \sqrt{ (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 }.\]</span> Suppose the we
        divided the original curve into <span class="math inline">$n$</span> segments at points <span
            class="math inline">$(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})$</span> on the curve, and we let <span
            class="math inline">$\Delta x_i$</span> and <span class="math inline">$\Delta y_i$</span> denote the
        horizontal and vertical differences between consecutive points (i.e., <span class="math inline">$\Delta x_i =
            x_{i+1} - x_i$</span> and <span class="math inline">$\Delta y_i = y_{i+1} - y_i$</span>). Then the
        arc-length can be approximated by the sum of the length of the straight line segment connecting consecutive
        points. That is, <span class="math display">\[s \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{ (\Delta x_i)^2 + (\Delta y_i)^2
            }.\]</span> Here, we assume <span class="math inline">$\Delta x_i$</span> to be nonzero, so this
        expression can be rewritten as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            s
            &\approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{ (\Delta x_i)^2 + (\Delta y_i)^2 } \\
            &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{
            \left[
            \left( \frac{\Delta x_i}{\Delta x_i} \right)^2 +
            \left( \frac{\Delta y_i}{\Delta x_i} \right)^2
            \right] \Delta x_i^2 } \\
            &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{
            1 +
            \left( \frac{\Delta y_i}{\Delta x_i} \right)^2
            } \, \Delta x_i.
            \end{aligned}\]</span> The expression <span class="math inline">$\Delta y_i / \Delta x_i$</span> should
        look familiar — it is the average rate of change of this function over the <span
            class="math inline">$i$</span>-th interval (rise over run). By the Mean Value Theorem, for each <span
            class="math inline">$i=1,\dots,n$</span>, there exists a point <span
            class="math inline">$\bar{x}_i$</span> in the interval <span class="math inline">$[x_i,x_{i+1}]$</span>
        where <span class="math inline">$\Delta y_i / \Delta x_i$</span> is exactly the derivative at <span
            class="math inline">$\bar{x}_i$</span>. Therefore, <span class="math display">\[s \approx \sum_{i=1}^n
            \sqrt{
            1 +
            \left( f&#39;(\bar{x}_i) \right)^2
            } \, \Delta x_i.\]</span> This is already a useful formula for <em>approximating</em> the arc-length.
        However, we are not interested in a mere approximation. <em>We want the exact formula</em>. Again, following the
        general recipe of calculus ideas, we take the limit of the above expression as the length of each segment goes
        to zero (and the number of segment goes to infinity), which results in the formula <span
            class="math display">\[L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ 1 + \left[ f&#39;(x) \right]^2 } dx.\]</span></p>
    <h2 id="the-differential-point-of-view" class="unnumbered">The differential point of view</h2>
    <p>The resulting formula derived above can be understood as <span class="math display">\[L = \int ds\]</span> where
        <span class="math inline">$ds$</span> is the expression that represents the length of infinitely small
        (infinitesimal) segment of the curve. This is a very general idea in many computational problems involving
        integrals — if you know how to express an infinitesimal version of certain quantity, then this quantity can be
        computed as an integral of such infinitesimal version.</p>
    <p><strong>Alternative notation.</strong> In engineering context, people often prefer the notations <span
            class="math display">\[L = \int ds
            \quad\text{where}\quad
            ds = \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 }.\]</span> These notations, based on manipulations of differentials, are indeed
        valid, although they are incompatible with how we use differential so far. We will not use them here, but you
        should be aware of these notations because you will likely see them elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Can you see the connection between this version of the arc-length formula and the version stated earlier?</p>

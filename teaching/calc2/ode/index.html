        A differential equation is an equation

        You can find them almost everywhere in science and engineering
        since many scientific principles

    <h3>What is a differential equation?</h3>
    <p>
        A <b>differential equation</b> is an equation
        that involves <em>derivatives</em> or <em>differentials</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        You can find them almost everywhere in science and engineering.
        E.g., Newton's law of motion is stated as
        \[
            F = \frac{d}{dt} \left( m \frac{dy}{dt} \right).
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Simple harmonic motion
        (e.g. metronomes) is described by
        \[
            \frac{d^2}{dt^2} y = -\frac{k}{m} y.
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        These are very simple examples.
        The differential equations we encounter in applications
        tend to be much more complicated.
        The idea of differential equation
        is an integral part of science and engineering,
        as many "laws" and "principles" are stated in terms of differential equations.

    <h3>Solving a differential equation</h3>
    <p>
        <em>To solve a differential equation</em> 
        means to find such a function that satisfies the equation.
        This, it turns out is not always possible.
        Only the simplest differential equations admit solutions
        that can be written down explicitly.
        Of course, some differential equations have no solutions at all.

    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        <b>Problem.</b>
        Can we find a function $y$ of $x$ such that
        \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = 7 \, ? \]
        That is, do you know a function $y(x)$ whose derivative is 7?
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
    <b>Problem.</b>
        Can we find a function $y$ of $x$ such that
        \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = x \,? \]
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>The first class of differential equations</h3>
    <p>
        One of the simplest class of differential equations 
        are those of the form
        \[ y' = f(x) \]
        (or any form that can be rearrange into this form)
        where the right hand side does <em>not</em> involve $y$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        It is easy to see that
        \[
            y(x) = \int f(x) dx
        \]
        will be our answer, 
        as long as the integral on the right hand side is defined.
        This is how antiderivative works.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>A "differential" point of view</h3>
    <p>
        Alternatively, we can look at the same procedure 
        from a different viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        From
        \[
            \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x),
        \]
        we can integrate both sides with respect to $x$, and get
        \begin{align*}
            \int \frac{dy}{dx} dx = \int f(x) dx \quad
            &\Rightarrow \quad \int dy = \int f(x) dx \\
            &\Rightarrow \quad y = \int f(x) dx.
        \end{align*}
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Keep in mind that the expression $\int f(x) dx$
        does not represent a single function.
        It is a whole <em>family of functions</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        <b>Problem.</b>
        In the above derivation,
        do you know why we can turn $\frac{dy}{dx} dx$ into $dy$ ?
        (Hint: it's not <em>not</em> cancellation)
    </p>
    
</section>
<section>
    <h3>The general result</h3>
    <div class="theorem"><p>
        If $f(x)$ is integrable over an interval,
        then the solutions to the differential equation
        \[ y' = f(x) \]
        are of the form
        \[
            y(x) = \int f(x) dx
        \]
        over that interval.
    </p></div>
    <p class="fragment">
        Again, it is important to understand that
        the indefinite integral on the right hand side
        represents a whole family of equally good solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        In practice, we also have to be careful with
        the domain and range of the solutions
        as the original equation or context
        may imply further restriction of the domain and range.
    </p>

    <h3>The second class of differential equations</h3>
    <p>
        Can we find a function $y$ of $x$ such that
        \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = y \, ? \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Just by guessing, it is not hard to see there are at least two solutions:
        The constant function $y = 0$ and the exponential function $y = e^x$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Indeed, $y = Ce^x$ would be a solution
        for any real number $C$ (including 0).
        This is a example "separable differential equations".
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Can we find a function $y$ of $x$ such that
        \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy \, ? \]
    </p>

<section>
    <h3>Separable differential equations</h3>
    <div class="theorem"><p>
        <b>Definition.</b>
        A differential equation in $y(x)$ is <b>separable</b> 
        if it is of the form
        \[
            \frac{dy}{dx} = A(y) B(x)
        \]
        where $A(y)$ does not involve $x$
        and   $B(x)$ does not involve $y$.
    </p></div>
    <p class="fragment">
        Under the assumption that $A(y) \ne 0$,
        it can be turned into
        \[
            \frac{1}{A(y)} \frac{dy}{dx} = B(x).
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Integrating both sides with respect to $x$, we get
        \begin{align*}
            \int \frac{1}{A(y)} \frac{dy}{dx} dt &= \int B(x) dx &
            &\text{i.e.,} &
            \int \frac{1}{A(y)} dy &= \int B(x) dx.
        \end{align*}
        <em>If</em> we can compute both integrals,
        we will have an equation in $y$ without derivatives.
        Then, by solving the resulting equation,
        we can obtain the explicit solution $y$.
    </p>

<section>
    <p>
        <b>Example.</b>
        Find the general solution to the differential equation
        $ \frac{dy}{dx} = y^2. $
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        <b>Solution.</b>
        First, we can easily verify that $y(t) = 0$ is a solution.
        Now we will search for non-zero (never zero) solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Note that this equation is separable as we can write it as
        \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 \cdot 1. \]
    </p>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>
            Since we already imposed the restriction $y(x) \ne 0$,
            we can rearrange it into
        </p>
        <div class="aligned">
            <span>
                $\displaystyle \frac{1}{y^2} \frac{dy}{dx} = 1$
            </span>
            <span class="fragment">
                i.e., $\displaystyle \int \frac{1}{y^2} \frac{dy}{dx} dt = \int 1 dx$
            </span>
            <span class="fragment">
                i.e., $\displaystyle \int \frac{1}{y^2} dy = \int 1 dx$
            </span>
        </div>

    </div>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>
            Integrating the two sides separately, we get
        </p>
        <div class="aligned">
            <span>
                $\displaystyle \int \frac{1}{y^2} dy = -\frac{1}{y},$
            </span>
            <span class="fragment">
                and $\displaystyle \int 1 \, dx = x + C.$
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        Here, we only need a single "$+C$"
        since such constants will appear on both sides of the equation
        and can be combined into one.
    </p>
    <div class="fragment">
        <p>
            Therefore, the equations turn into
        </p>
        <div class="aligned">
            <span>
                $\displaystyle -\frac{1}{y} = x + C$
            </span>
            <span class="fragment">
                and thus
                $\displaystyle y = - \frac{1}{x+C}$.
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>

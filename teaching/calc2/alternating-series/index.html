    <h3>Alternating series</h3>
    <p>
        So far, most of the series we studied consists of positive terms.
        Such series converge or diverge in simple ways:
        If the terms shrink to 0 sufficiently quickly,
        the partial sums will have a finite limit and the series converges.
        Otherwise the series diverge.
        We will consider more complicated situations
        where a series contain positive and negative terms.
        We will focus on the special case of alternating series.

        <b>Definition.</b>
        An <b>alternating series</b> is a series
        whose terms have alternating signs.
        It can be written in the form
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k c_k
            \quad\text{or}\quad
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} c_k
            \quad
            \text{for <em>positive</em> } c_1,c_2,\ldots.
        \]
        for some <em>positive</em> numbers $c_1,c_2,\ldots$.
    </p></div>
    <!-- <p>
    Here $(-1)^k$ and $(-1)^{k+1}$ are the standard ways to express
    alternating signs (depending on if you start with $-1$ or $+1$).

        <b>Alternating series test.</b>
        An alternating series of the form
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k c_k
            \quad\text{or}\quad
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} c_k
            \quad
            \text{for <em>positive</em> } c_1,c_2,\ldots
        \]
        converges if $c_k \ge c_{k+1}$
        and $\lim_{k \to c_k} c_k = 0$.
    </p></div>
    <!-- <p>
    \noindent
    It is important to remember this test is only valid for alternating series
    and is not to be confused with the ``divergence test''.
    </p> -->
    <p>
        By this test, we can confirm the <b>alternating harmonic series</b>
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}
            = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots
        \]
        is convergent
        (even though the harmonic series diverges).
    </p>
    <p>
        Its convergence depends on the intricate cancellation between 
        positive and negative terms
        We will see the detail in later discussions.
        Indeed, it converges to $\ln 2$ (we will see why).

    <h3>Absolute convergence</h3>
    <p>
        We can see the convergence of the alternating harmonic series
        is a very weak form of convergence --- it converges only because
        of the cancellation between positive and negative terms.
        Convergence of this form can be very strange.
        To further distinguish this and the more robust form of converges,
        we have the concept of ``absolute convergence''.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem"><p>
        We say a series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ <b>converges absolutely</b>
        (or it exhibits <b>absolute convergence</b>)
        if $\sum_{k=1}^\infty |a_k|$ converges.
        On the other hand, if $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ converges
        but $\sum_{k=1}^\infty |a_k|$ diverges,
        we say the series <b>converges conditionally</b>
        (or it exhibits <b>conditional convergence</b>).
    </p></div>
    <p>
        The alternating harmonic series is a classical example of a series
        that exhibits conditional convergence ---
        $\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} / k$ converges,
        but $\sum_{k=1}^\infty 1 / k$ diverges.

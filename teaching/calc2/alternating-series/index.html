    <h3>Alternating series</h3>
    <p>
        So far, most of the series we studied consists of positive terms.
        Such series converge or diverge in fairly simple ways.
        We will consider more complicated situations
        where a series contain positive and negative terms.
        We will focus on the special case of alternating series.

        <b>Definition.</b>
        An <b>alternating series</b> is a series
        whose terms have alternating signs.
        It can be written in the form
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k c_k
            \quad\text{or}\quad
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} c_k
            \quad
            \text{for positive } c_1,c_2,\ldots.
        \]
    </p></div>
    <!-- <p>
    Here $(-1)^k$ and $(-1)^{k+1}$ are the standard ways to express
    alternating signs (depending on if you start with $-1$ or $+1$).

        <b>Alternating series test.</b>
        An alternating series of the form
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k c_k
            \quad\text{or}\quad
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} c_k
            \quad
            \text{for positive } c_1,c_2,\ldots
        \]
        converges if both of the following conditions hold:
        <ul>
            <li>
                $c_k \ge c_{k+1}$ (the magnitude of terms are non-increasing)
            </li>
            <li>
                $\lim_{k \to \infty} c_k = 0$
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p></div>
    <!-- <p>
    \noindent
    It is important to remember this test is only valid for alternating series
    and is not to be confused with the ``divergence test''.
    </p> -->
    <p class="fragment">
        By this test, we can confirm the <b>alternating harmonic series</b>
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}
            = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots
        \]
        is convergent
        (even though the harmonic series diverges).
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        Its convergence depends on the intricate cancellation between 
        positive and negative terms
        We will see the detail in later discussions.
        Indeed, it converges to $\ln 2$ (we will see why).

    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>
        The series 
        \[ 
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{\sqrt{k}} 
            = -1 
            + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
            - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} 
            + \frac{1}{\sqrt{4}} 
            - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} 
            + \cdots
        \]
        also satisfies the two conditions
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} > \frac{1}{\sqrt{k + 1}}$ (the magnitude of terms are non-increasing)
        </li>
        <li>
            $\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} = 0$
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Therefore, we can conclude that this series converges.
    </p>

    <h3>Nonexamples</h3>
    <p>
        It is crucial to understand when <b>not</b> to use
        alternating series test.
        For the following alternating series,
        the conditions of the tests are not satisfies:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - \cdots 
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        \[
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}-1} - 
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}-1} + 
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}-1} - 
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}-1} + 
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{4}-1} - 
            \cdots 
        \]

    <h3>Absolute convergence</h3>
    <p>
        The convergence of the <em>alternating harmonic series</em>
        is a weak form of convergence --- it converges only because
        of the cancellation between positive and negative terms.
        To further distinguish this and the more robust form of converges,
        we have the concept of "absolute convergence".
    </p>
    <div class="theorem"><p>
        We say a series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ <b>converges absolutely</b>
        (or it exhibits <b>absolute convergence</b>)
        if $\sum_{k=1}^\infty |a_k|$ converges.
        On the other hand, if $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ converges
        but $\sum_{k=1}^\infty |a_k|$ diverges,
        we say the series <b>converges conditionally</b>
        (or it exhibits <b>conditional convergence</b>).
    </p></div>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Example: absolute convergence</h3>
    <p>
        From what we know about geometric series we can see the
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^k
        \]
        exhibits absolute convergence since
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left| (-1)^{k+1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^k \right|
            = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^k
        \]
        converges.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Absolute convergence implies convergence</h3>
    <p>
        It is important to understand that absolute convergence is a
        stronger condition than convergence,
        even though this is not clear from the definition.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
        <p><b>Theorem.</b>
            If a series converges absolutely,
            then it converges.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Example: conditional convergence</h3>
    <p>
        The alternating harmonic series is an example of 
        conditionally convergent series:
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} \quad\text{converges,}
        \]
        but 
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k} \quad\text{diverges.}
        \]

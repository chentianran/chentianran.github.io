    <h3>Why we need comparison tests?</h3>
    <p>
        We learned quite a few tests that can tell us if a series is 
        convergent or divergent indirectly without computing partial sum,
        e.g. integral tests.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="1-2.mp3">
        But for many series, this can be difficult. E.g.,
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2 + 1}
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="1-3.mp3">
        We already know the series
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}
        \]
        is convergent.
        What can this tell us about the series above?

    <h3>Direct comparison test</h3>
    <p>
        This test work by comparing two series term by term directly.
        For this to work nicely we have to restrict ourselves to
        series of <em>nonnegative terms</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem fragment" data-audio-src="2-2.mp3"><p>
        If $0 \le a_k \le c_k$ for all positive integer $k$,
        and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k$ converges, 
        then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ also converges.
    </p></div>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="2-3.mp3">
        Since the terms are nonnegative, 
        terms must shrink to 0 quickly enough for the series to converge;
        If each term is bounded by the corresponding term in a series
        whose terms are known to shrink to 0 sufficiently quickly,
        then we can conclude the original series also converge.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>
        Since
        \[
            \frac{1}{k^2 + 1} \quad < \quad \frac{1}{k^2}
        \]
    </p>
    we can conclude that
    <p>
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2 + 1} \text{ converges} 
            \quad \Longleftarrow \quad 
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \text{ converges}
        \]
    </p>

<section data-audio-src="4-1.mp3">
    <p>
        Similarly, we can determine if a series is divergent by comparing it to a divergent series.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem"><p>
        If $a_k \ge d_k \ge 0$ for all positive integer $k$,
        and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty d_k$ diverges, 
        then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ also diverges.
    </p></div>
    <div class="fragment" data-audio-src="4-2.mp3">
        <p>
            For example, since
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                $\frac{1}{k - \frac{1}{3}} \,>\, \frac{1}{k}$, and
            </li>
            <li>
                $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}$ (the harmonic series) is divergent.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We can conclude $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k - \frac{1}{3}}$ is also divergent.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- <p>
        Again, we can always remove any finite list of terms from a series
        without changing its convergence property.
        Therefore the phrase ``for all positive integer $k$''
        in both of the tests above can be replace by
        ``for all $k \ge N$'' for some fixed positive integer $N$.

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <p>
        Use the direct comparison tests 
        to determine the convergence properties of the following series:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2 + k + 1}$
        </li>
        <li>
            $\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k - 1}$
        </li>
        <li>
            $\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{\cos(k)}{k^2}$
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Limit comparison test</h3>
    <p>
        The direct comparison test stated above is quite easy to use 
        <em>if</em> we can find reference series that satisfy the hypothesis,
        which is not always easy.
        For example, we wouldn't be able to compare
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k + 1}
            \quad\text{to}\quad
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}
            \;\text{(harmonic series)}
        \]
        using direct comparison test, because $\frac{1}{k+1} < \frac{1}{k}$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" data-audio-src="6-2.mp3">
        The limit comparison test replaces such direct comparisons
        with comparisons using limits, which can be much more forgiving.

            <b>Limit comparison test.</b>
            Let $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k$ be two series
            with $a_k, b_k \ge 0$.

                then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k$

        For example, applying this to 
        $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}$ and 
        $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k + 1}$, since
        \[
            \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{1}{k} }{ \frac{1}{k+1} } =
            \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ k + 1 }{ k } =
            \lim_{k \to \infty} 1 + \frac{ 1 }{ k } = 1,
        \]
        the two series either both converge or both diverge.
        But we already the harmonic series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}$ diverges,
        thus the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k + 1}$ also diverges.

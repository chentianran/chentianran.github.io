    <h2 class="title">Comparison tests for series</h2>
    <p class="footnote2">
        We studied several family of series in detail.
        We also learned quite a few tests that can tell us if a series converge or diverge
        indirectly without computing partial sum.
        We can also compare one series to another series
        whose convergence/divergence property is known.

    <h3>Direct comparison test</h3>
    <p>
        This test work by comparing two series term by term directly.
        For this to work nice we have to restrict ourselves to
        series of <em>nonnegative terms</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem"><p>
        If $0 \le a_k \le c_k$ for all positive integer $k$,
        and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k$ converges, 
        then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ also converges.
    </p></div>
    <p>
        Since the terms are nonnegative, 
        terms must shrink to 0 quickly enough for the series to converge;
        If each term is bounded by the corresponding term in a series
        whose terms are known to shrink to 0 sufficiently quickly,
        then we can conclude the original series also converge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since
        \[
            \frac{1}{k^2 + 1} \quad < \quad \frac{1}{k^2}
        \]
    </p>
    we can conclude that
    <p>
        \[
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2 + 1} \text{ converges} 
            \quad \Longleftarrow \quad 
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \text{ converges}
        \]
    </p>

        Similarly, we can determine if a series is divergent by comparing it to a divergent series.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem"><p>
        If $a_k \ge d_k \ge 0$ for all positive integer $k$,
        and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty d_k$ diverges, 
        then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ also diverges.
    </p></div>
    <!-- <p>
        Again, we can always remove any finite list of terms from a series
        without changing its convergence property.
        Therefore the phrase ``for all positive integer $k$''
        in both of the tests above can be replace by
        ``for all $k \ge N$'' for some fixed positive integer $N$.

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <h3>Limit comparison test</h3>
    <p>
        The direct comparison test stated above is quite easy to use 
        <em>if</em> we can find reference series that satisfy the hypothesis,
        which is not always easy.
        The ``limit comparison test'' replaces such direct comparisons
        with comparisons using limits, which can be much more forgiving.

            Let $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k$ be two series
            with $a_k, b_k \ge 0$.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If $\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k}$ is <em>finite</em> and <em>nonzero</em>,
                then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k$
                either <em>both converge or both diverge</em>.

                If $\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} = \infty$
                (i.e., $\frac{a_k}{b_k}$ grows unboundedly)
                and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k$ diverges,
                then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ also diverges.

    <p class="footnote2">
        So far we studied series of numbers.
        The question we will be answering today is:
        Can we get some variables involved and use series to represent functions?

    <h3>Motivations</h3>
    <p>
        We studied geometric series of the form
        \[
            \sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4 + \cdots
        \]
        and we now know exactly for which $r$ this series will converge.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        A natural question to ask is then:
        Can we treat $r$ as a variable?
        And will that produce a function?
        This is what power series is all about.

    <h3>Power series</h3>

    <p>
        They are expressions that look like
        polynomials with <em>infinite </em> number of terms.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        A <b>power series centered at $x=0$</b> (or about $x=0$)
        is an expression of the form
        \[
            \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k x^k =
            c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + \cdots
        \]
        where $c_0,c_1,c_2,\ldots$ are real constants known as <b>coefficients</b>.
    </p>
</section>
<section>

    <p>
    In general, a <b>power series centered at</b> 
    $x = a$ is an expression
    \[
        \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k (x-a)^k
        = c_0 + c_1 (x-a) + c_2 (x-a)^2 + c_3 (x-a)^3 + \cdots
    \]
    for some real constants (the coefficients)
    $c_0,c_1,c_2,\ldots$.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Simply put, a power series is an infinite series
        in which each term has a <em>nonnegative</em> power of an variable.
    </p>

    <h3>Does a power series define a function?</h3>
    <p>
        Keep in mind that we may <em>not</em> be able to 
        assign meaningful value to it once we ``plug in'' a value for $x$
        --- as we know by now, not all series have meaningful values.
        This is the question of <em>convergence</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        It is clear that a power series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k(x-a)^k$ 
        always converges at its center $x=a$:
        If we "plug in" $x=a$, we get
        \[
            c_0 + c_1 (a-a) + c_2 (a-a)^2 + \cdots
            = c_0 + 0 + 0 + \cdots
            = c_0.
        \]
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        An important question we need to study is that
        given a power series centered at $x=a$,
        are there any other value we can plug in for $x$
        and get a convergent series (and hence a meaningful value)?
    </p>

    <h3>Radius of convergence</h3>
    <p>
        Each power series centered at $x=a$
        has a <em>radius of convergence</em> such that
        for any $x$ within this radius around its center,
        the series <em>converges</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem"><p>
        A power series $\sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k (x-a)^k$
        has three possibilities:
        <ol>
            <li> 
                This series converges only at $x=a$ and diverges for all other $x$ values.
                In this case, we say this series has a <b>radius of converges</b> of 0.
            </li>
            <li> 
                This series converges for all $x$ values.
                In this case, we say this series has a <b>radius of converges</b> of $\infty$.
            </li>
            <li>
                There exists a real $R > 0$ such that this series\ldots
                <ul>
                    <li> converges for all $x$ such that $|x - a| < R$, and</li>
                    <li> diverges  for all $x$ such that $|x - a| > R$.
                </ul>
                We call $R$ the <b>radius of converges</b> of this series.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p></div>

    <p>
        In these cases, the set of real numbers for which
        the series converge form a interval,
        and it is called the <b>interval of convergence</b> of the power series.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within this interval of convergence,
        power series having the same center <em>can be manipulated algebraically</em>,
        e.g., the can be added, and multiplied.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        For example,
        \begin{align*}
            \sum_{k=0} b_k (x-a)^k
            +
            \sum_{k=0} c_k (x-a)^k
            &=
            \sum_{k=0} (b_k + c_k) (x-a)^k \\
            b \cdot \sum_{k=0} c_k (x-a)^k
            &=
            \sum_{k=0} b c_k (x-a)^k
        \end{align*}
    </p>

    <h3>Power series as functions</h3>
    <p>
        When the interval of convergence consists of more than one number,
        within this interval,
        the power series defines a function that is continuous and differentiable.
        Indeed, we can show that all derivatives
        of this function exists and are continuous in that interval.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        This also means, within their interval of convergence,
        power series can be differentiated and integrated <em>term by term</em>.
        \[
            \frac{d}{dx} \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k (x-a)^k
            =
            \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{d}{dx} \left[ c_k (x-a)^k \right]
            =
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k k (x-a)^{k-1}
        \]
    </p>

    <h3>Analytic functions</h3>

    <p>
        Functions given by power series are called are called <b>analytic functions</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Many familiar functions in calculus are analytic. For Example,
        \begin{align*}
            e^t &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k}{k!} &
            \ln(1+t) &= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{ (-1)^{k-1} }{k} t^k &
            \\
            \cos(t) &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k t^{2k}}{(2k)!} &
            \sin(t) &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k t^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}
        \end{align*}
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Historically, power series are the main weapons for mathematicians for a long time.
        It is likely that mathematicians thought that all "reasonable" functions are analytic.
        This assumption turn out to be quite wrong.
        Nonetheless, power series remain extremely useful in applied mathematics.

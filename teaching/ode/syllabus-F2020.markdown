<!-- My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course. -->
<!-- In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice). -->

### What we will learn

This course will cover selected topics from _Ordinary Differential Equations_. 
Upon successful completion of this course the you will have 
an understanding of and ability to apply each of the following topics:

* First-order differential equations
* Higher-order (especially second-order) differential equations
* Linear differential equations
* Nonlinear differential equations
* Infinite series solutions
* Laplace transforms
* Systems of linear differential equations
* Boundary-value problems (optional)
* Various applications (optional)

### Prerequisite

In order to succeed in this class, certain basic mathematical skills are necessary.
In particular, we need to feel comfortable with basic calculus concepts and techniques.
These prerequisite can be satisfied by:

* MATH-1620 (Calculus II) or equivalent courses

Multivariable calculus is not required.
But certain more advanced topics will involve discussions
relating to partial derivatives.

### Textbook

* [Required] _Differential Equations and Their Applications: An Introduction to Applied Mathematics_
  by Martin Braun (any edition would be fine)
  (4th edition â€‹ISBN: 978-0387978949)
* [Optional] _Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems_
  by Dennis Zill & Warren Wright (any edition would be fine)

Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from 
the _required_ textbook.


### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom or in virtual meetings 
and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the meeting
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
According to AUM Mathematics Department Calculator Policy,
students are required to have a graphing calculator
(TI-84 is recommended).
The use of such calculators may be required for certain homework problems
or in-class activities.
However, all in-class quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities
are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

### Instruction method

In this semester, we will adopt a "blended flipped" model.
This means lectures are replaced by a series of short videos.
You are expected to watch these videos and read our textbook.

In addition, you are expected to meet with me either in-person or virtually
(via Zoom) at least once each week.
In these meetings, I will answer your question work on problem with you,
go over worksheets, or have other discussions related to this course.
These meetings will be a component of your course grade.
See detailed explanation below.

### Reading tests

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
__Late submission will receive lower scores__
unless valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided, preferably _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish each reading test at least a few days
before the due date.

<!-- Each reading test allows multiple attempts. -->
<!-- Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail. -->

### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests called "concept tests"
on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
Please see the "concept tests" folder on the Blackboard system for detail.
<!-- All concepts tests are due on the last day of classes, -->
<!-- and __no late submission will be accepted__. -->
<!-- However, it is strongly recommended that you complete them as early as possible. -->

<!-- ### In-class and online quizzes

There will be a short quiz most of the weeks.
our understanding of the material discussed in the previous meeting.
__No makeup quiz will be offered__.
However, a missing quiz may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of zero. -->

### Weekly survey

Each week you will be asked to complete a survey.
The completion of each survey worth 0.333...% of your course grade.
__Late submissions will receive lower scores__.

### Weekly problem sessions / virtual check-in sessions

Each week, you will be required to...

* either attend an in-person problem session
  (place and time listed on the top of this document), or...
* have an one-on-one meeting (virtual check-in session)
  with me via Zoom.
  You can find a link to a scheduling system on my course page
  (and the Blackboard course page)
  with which you can schedule a weekly meeting.

These meetings will give us opportunities to have one-on-one
or close to one-on-one discussions
(in-person problem sessions will not be one-on-one).
In these meetings, we will...

* answer your questions,
* go over problems,
* let you complete worksheets (see below)

Your participation in these meetings (either in-person or virtual)
will be a component in your course grade.
Your attendance in each meeting worth 0.333...% of your course grade.

### Worksheet problems

In in-person or virtual problem sessions,
you will be given worksheets that contain short problems for you to complete.
There are 20 worksheets in total, you can try to complete each worksheet multiple times,
although you will only have at most one attempt on any worksheet in each problem session.
In each attempt, you can...

* work on problems by yourself under time limit,
  in which case your result will be graded; or
* ask me to show you how to do the problems,
  in which case your result will not be graded.

Note that you will receive slightly different versions of the same problem in each attempt.

<!-- In-class practice is a crucially important component of the learning process.
Your in-class worksheets will be _collected and graded_. -->

<!-- ### Projects
Projects are more complicated mathematical problems that will
guide you to gain deeper understanding of the material we learn in class.
They are a major part of your course grade. -->

<!-- ### Final exam
The final exam will take place in the last day of class.
It constitutes a major part of your course grade. -->

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of quizzes,
the in-class worksheets, projects, and the final exam,
and is calculated according to the following weights.

| Component          | Points | Where/how         |
|--------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Reading tests      |   20   | Blackboard        |
| Concept tests      |   20   | Blackboard        |
| Worksheets         |   50   | In person or Zoom |
| Meeting attendance |    5   | In person or Zoom |
| Surveys            |    5   | Online            |

### Grading scale

* A : 90% - 100%
* B+: 84% - 89.9%
* B : 80% - 83.9%
* C+: 74% - 79.9%
* C : 70% - 73.9%
* D+: 64% - 69.9%
* D : 60% - 63.9%
* F : below 60%

My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

This course will cover selected topics from _Ordinary Differential Equations_. 
Upon successful completion of this course the you will have 
an understanding of and ability to apply each of the following topics:

* First-order differential equations
* Higher-order (especially second-order) differential equations
* Linear differential equations
* Nonlinear differential equations
* Infinite series solutions
* Laplace transforms
* Systems of linear differential equations
* Boundary-value problems (optional)
* Various applications (optional)

### Prerequisite

In order to succeed in this class, certain basic mathematical skills are necessary.
In particular, we need to feel comfortable with basic calculus concepts and techniques.
These prerequisite can be satisfied by:

* MATH-1620 (Calculus II) or equivalent courses

Multivariable calculus is not required.
But certain more advanced topics will involve discussions
relating to partial derivatives.

### Textbook

* [Required] _Differential Equations and Their Applications: An Introduction to Applied Mathematics_
  by Martin Braun (any edition would be fine)
  (4th edition â€‹ISBN: 978-0387978949)
* [Optional] _Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems_
  by Dennis Zill & Warren Wright (any edition would be fine)

Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from 
the _required_ textbook.

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Your attendance is therefore expected.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems, but they are _not required_.

### Reading tests

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
__No late submission will be accepted__.
However, a missing reading test may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish the reading test 
at least a few days before the due date.

Each reading test allows __two attempts__.
Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail.

### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
All concepts tests are due on the last day of classes
(but before the final week),
and __no late submission will be accepted__.
However, it is strongly recommended that you complete them as early as possible.

### In-class quizzes

Short in-class quizzes are designed
to test our understanding of the material discussed.
These quizzes will be a major part of your course grade.
On each quiz you can choose _one of 20 problems_
(with a few additional bonus problems).
You can choose the same problem multiple times,
but only the highest score on each problem is recorded.

Problem 1 -- 5 can be chosen at any time.
But Problem 6 -- 20 can be chosen only after you
_received perfect scores on all previous problems_.
For example, in order to choose Problem 8 on a quiz,
you need to first receive _perfect_ scores on
Problem 1,2,...,6,7.

### Homework

Practice in problem solving is an important part of this course.
Problems will be assigned on the _Blackboard system_.
These problems will be graded and will be a major component
in your course grade.

<!-- ### Worksheets

Worksheet problems will also be assigned in class.
Since these must be completed in class,
__no makeup worksheets will be offered__.
However, a missing worksheet may be excused if valid reasons
(official university events, illness or medical emergencies,
death of immediate family, military orders, jury duty,
religious holidays, or extreme weather conditions)
and _proper documentation_ are provided (preferably _in advance_).
Otherwise, a missing worksheet receives a score of _zero_. -->

### Final exam

Final exam, designed to test your overall understanding of the core concepts,
is scheduled at __10:45am -- 12:00pm__ on __Tuesday, Dec. 10__.

### Grade composition

Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of
homework, projects, quizzes, and the final exam,
and is calculated according to the following weights:

| Component        | Points | Where      |
|------------------|--------|------------|
| Concept tests    |  10%   | Blackboard |
| Reading tests    |  20%   | Blackboard |
| Homework         |  30%   | Blackboard |
| 20 problems      |  30%   | In-class   |
| Final            |  10%   | In-class   |
| Participation    |   2%   | In-class   |

### Grading scale

* A: 90% - 100%
* B: 80% - 89.9%
* C: 70% - 79.9%
* D: 60% - 69.9%
* F: below 60%

Border line grades are determined by in-class participation
(in discussions and activities) as well as attendance.

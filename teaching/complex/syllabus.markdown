{% include hours.markdown %}

My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

* The concept of complex numbers
* Arithmetic involving complex numbers
* Analytic functions
* Elementary functions
* Integrals over complex numbers
* Complex power series 
* Residue and poles
* Conformal mappings (time permitting). 

### Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course,
you will be equipped with the understanding of 
the fundamental concepts of complex variable theory.

### Prerequisite

__MATH-2630__ (Multivariable Calculus)

In order to succeed in this class,
a solid understanding of calculus
and basic algebra is necessary.

### Textbook

The following textbooks are recommended.

* _Complex Variables and Applications_ (Ninth Edition)
  by __James Ward Brown and Ruel V. Churchill__
  (ISBN 9780073383170).

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected.
_Students missing 6 or more classes without an approved excuse
will receive an F grade_.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities
are _not_ allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

<!-- ### Reading assignments

You are expected to read the book in preparation of each class meetings.
Reading assignments, i.e., sections (from the required textbook) are listed
on the Blackboard system.
The reading assignments are to be completed _before_ each class meeting. -->

### Daily quizzes and the progression system

Short quizzes will be given in class meetings to test
your understanding of the material.
You can repeat each quiz as many times as you like, but
__you can only take a quiz after receiving full scores on all previous quizzes__.
For example, you can only take quiz (level) 5
after you received _full scores_ on quizzes 1 through 4.
If you missed a chance to take quiz for valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc),
please provide _proper documentation_,
and you will be given an additional chance to take the quizzes
during the final week.

For each full score you earn on a new quiz,
you will increase your "level" by one.
Your course grade is determined by the level you are in
at the end of the semester
according to the following table

| Level | Grade |
|-------|-------|
| <10   | F     |
| 10    | D     |
| 11    | D     |
| 12    | D     |
| 13    | C     |
| 14    | C     |
| 15    | C     |
| 16    | B     |
| 17    | B     |
| 18    | B     |
| 19    | A     |
| 20    | A(+)  |

For example, after receiving full scores on quiz 1 -- 13,
you become a "Level 13" student,
and your course grade will be at least C.

### Additional levels

In addition to the daily quizzes,
you can earn additional levels by completing
concept tests, homework assignments, and final exam,
as well as participating in in-class discussions.

| Component     | Points |
|---------------|--------|
| Concept tests | 100    |
| Homework      | 100    |
| Participation |  20    |

The number of additional levels you will earn
is determined by the number of points you received
in the components listed in the table above.

| Points      | Additional levels |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 120 or more | +1 level          |
| 180 or more | +2 levels         |
| 200 or more | +3 levels         |

### Concept tests

You will complete short online tests on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
All concepts tests are due on the last day of classes,
and __no late submission will be accepted__.
However, it is strongly recommended that you complete them as early as possible.

### Homework assignments

Homework problems are more complicated mathematical problems that will
guide you to gain deeper understanding of the material we learn in class.
These problems are listed on our Blackboard system,
and _they must be submitted via the Blackboard system_.
Submission must be in __PDF__ format.
__Late homework submission will receive lower scores__
unless valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency
and other reasons approved by AUM)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, the factor of score scaling is $(0.8)^t$
where $t$ is the number of days after the due date.

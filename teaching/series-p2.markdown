# Hyperharmonic series (P=2)

A hyperharmonic series (a.k.a. P-series) is a generalization of the
[harmonic series](series-p1/) that has the form
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}$$ for some fixed real number $$p$$.
If you plug in $$p=1$$, you get exactly the harmonic series.
The demo below shows how the partial sum $$S$$ of the hyperharmonic series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}$$ grows as $$n \to \infty$$.
Can you tell if it converges to a number?
What will that number be?

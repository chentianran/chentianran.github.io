MTH-299
=======

This course acts as a bridge from your training in calculus which typically
focuses on formulas and calculations to that of higher mathematics which
focuses on abstraction, problem solving, and proof.
You will be taught to think independently, to digest abstract concepts and
tools from higher mathematics, and to express yourself clearly in a
mathematical proof.
You will be exposed to and learn some basic concepts from real analysis
(rigorous calculus), linear algebra (things similar to vectors and matrices
from vector calculus), number theory, and group theory.
You will be expected to become proficient with the structure of mathematical logic,
including truth tables, and you will be expected to become proficient in some
basic styles of proof, such as: direct proof, proof by contradiction, proof by
induction, proof by contrapositive, equivalences, and more.

Homework assignments
====================

A homework will be assigned each week (usually on Mondays), 
and it is due the following Monday at the beginning of the class meeting.
Late homework is not accepted without an excused absence.
Not every homework problem will be graded.
Once the graded homework has been returned,
students are expected to revise the solutions (by rewriting it).
This revision is due the following Monday (together with the original graded work),
and it will also be graded.
In other words, _each homework assignment is graded twice_: 
once for the first draft and once for the revision. 

* [Homework 1](299-hw1.pdf) (Due date: 9/03): 
    The purpose of this homework is to give students a preview 
    of the type of problems we will be dealing with this semester.
    Students are not expected to give complete solutions.
    Some of the problems will be revisited in future homework assignments.
* Homework 2 (Due date: 9/08) Solutions
* Homework 3 (Due date: 9/15) Solutions

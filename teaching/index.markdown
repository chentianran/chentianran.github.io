Homework assignments
====================

A homework will be assigned each week, 
and it is due the following Monday at the beginning of the class meeting.
Late homework is not accepted without an excused absence.
Not every homework problem will be graded.
Once the graded homework (first draft) has been returned,
students are expected to revise the solutions
according to the remarks and suggestions provided by the instructor.
This revision is due the following Monday (together with the original graded work),
and it will also be graded.
In other words, each homework assignment is graded twice: 
once for the first draft and once for the revision. 

In writing the revision, students are 
only required to address issues pointed out by the instructor.
In particular, if the instructor provided no comment on the (first draft),
then no revision is needed.

* [Homework 1](299-hw1.pdf) (Due date: 9/03): 
    The purpose of this homework is to give students a preview 
    of the type of problems we will be dealing with this semester.
    Students are not expected to give complete solutions.
    Some of the problems will be revisited in future homework assignments.
    For this assignment, the first draft worth 70%,
    while the revision worth 30%.
    ([Hints/suggestions for revision](299-hw1-hints.pdf))
* [Homework 2](299-hw2.pdf) (Due date: 9/15):
    This homework assignment focus on logic but also include some simple proofs.
* [Homework 3](299-hw3.pdf) (Due date: 9/22)


Lecture notes and in-class worksheets
=====================================

Be aware that these notes may not be up to date.

* [Lecture 2](299-lec2.pdf) (9/03):
    In this lecture we discuss basic concepts such as
    statements, negation, disjunction, conjunction, and implication.
* [Lecture 3](299-lec3.pdf) (9/05):
    This lecture discusses more advanced constructions
    including the converse, inverse, and the contrapositive of a logical implication
    together with biconditionals.
    With those, we define the concept of tautology and contradiction.
* [Lecture 4](299-lec4.pdf) (9/08):
    This lecture covers logical equivalence, certain "laws" of logic,
    and quantified statements.
* [Lecture 5](299-lec5.pdf) (9/10):
    More examples of quantified statements and the negation of quantified statements.
    This lecture also includes a quick review of logic (chapter 2).
* [Lecture 6](299-lec6.pdf) (9/12):
    Direct proofs via a few examples involving divisibility.
* [Lecture 7](299-lec7.pdf) (9/15):
    Proofs via multiple cases and contrapositives.
* Lecture 8 (9/17):
    Congruence and proofs involving congruence.

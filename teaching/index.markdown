Homework assignments
====================

Homework problems are assigned twice each week. 
Late homework is not accepted without an excused absence.
Not every homework problem will be graded.
Unless stated otherwise, once the graded homework (first draft) has been returned,
students are expected to revise the solutions
according to the remarks and suggestions provided by the instructor.
This revision is due the following week (together with the original graded work),
and it will also be graded.
In other words, each homework assignment is graded twice: 
once for the first draft and once for the revision. 

In writing the revision, students are 
only required to address issues pointed out by the instructor.
In particular, if the instructor provided no comment on the (first draft),
then no revision is needed.

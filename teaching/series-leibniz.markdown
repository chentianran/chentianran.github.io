# Leibniz series

The Leibniz series is very similar to the alternating harmonic series
except the denominators of the terms run through only the odd integers.
We write it as $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \frac{1}{2n-1}$$
where the power of $$(-1)$$ is used to express the alternating sign.
The demo below shows how the partial sum $$S$$ grows as $$n \to \infty$$.
Can you tell if it converges to a number?
And what will that number be?

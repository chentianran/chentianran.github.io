# Tangent line of a curve

A __tangent line__ to a curve at a given point is the straight line that
"just touches" the curve at that point.
Perhaps the name "_touching line_" would be much better.
As this line passes through the point where it meets the curve
(point of tangency) this line is suppose to "going in the same direction" as the curve.
Stated another way, a tangent line to a curve at a given point is the
best straight-line approximation of the curve near that point.

This definition is probably very confusing.
That's because we didn't use calculus.

In the demo below we have a curve and two points (red) on the curve.
We also have a line that cut through the curve at these two points.
We call such a line a __secant line__ of the curve
(and perhaps "cutting line" is a much better name).
Try use your mouse to move one of the point.
As you move this point to the other point,
the "cutting line" becomes the "touching line".

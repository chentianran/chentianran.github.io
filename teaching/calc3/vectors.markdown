# {{ page.title }}

In the context of calculus (as well as in physics and engineering),
a __vector__ is a geometry object that has both _magnitude_ and _direction_.
This concept is also known as "Euclidean vector" or "geometric vector".
Vectors are fundamental to the language of classical physics:
velocity, acceleration, and force are all vectors.

## Generalizations
In the much more general context of linear algebra, a vector can be any object
in a vector space which can be manipulated according to the rules of
vector algebra.

## Vectors in the plane

In the two-dimensional plane, a vector can be represented by two numbers ---
the vertical and horizontal "components".
They form the numerical coordinates of a vector in _standard basis_.

    <h3>Review: differentiability</h3>
    <p>
        Recall that partial and directional derivatives 
        are rather "weak" concepts for modeling the local changes
        of a function in several variables.
        We mentioned a stronger condition called "differentiability".
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        A function $f$, 
        in the $n$ variables $\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$,
        is said to be <b class="term">differentiable</b>
        at a point $\mathbf{x}_0$ (in the interior of its domain)
        if there exists a linear map $J: \mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}$ 
        such that
        \[
            \lim_{\mathbf{h} \to \mathbf{0}}
            \frac{ |\, f( \mathbf{x}_0 + \mathbf{h} ) - f( \mathbf{x}_0 ) - J(\mathbf{h}) \,| }{ \| \mathbf{h} \| }
            = 0.
        \]

    <div class="cols">

            <p>
                This is a very important concept.
                It is a direct generalization
                of the idea of differentiability for functions in one variables.

        </div>
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                This condition ensures the function can be approximated,
                to arbitrary precisions, by a linear function near a point.

    <h3>The case of two variables</h3>
    <p class="fragment">
        In case where $f$ is a function in the two variables $x$ and $y$,
        the <em class="term">differentiability</em> condition at $(x,y)$ is given by 
        \[
            \lim_{ (\Delta x,\Delta y) \to (0,0) }
            \frac{ | f( x + \Delta x, y + \Delta y ) - f( x, y ) - J(\Delta x,\Delta y) | }{ \sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 }}
            = 0.
        \]
        where $J: \mathbf{R}^2 \to \mathbf{R}$ is a linear map.
    </p>
    <p class="small fragment lowlight">
        In taking the limit as $(\Delta x,\Delta y) \to (0,0)$
        we allow $(\Delta x,\Delta y)$ to approach $(0,0)$ from any direction,
        and the limit must be independent from choices of directions.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        The term <em class="term">linear map</em> has very specific meanings.
        Indeed the linear map $J: \mathbf{R}^2 \to \mathbf{R}$ must be of the form
        \[
            J(\Delta x,\Delta y) = a \Delta x + b \Delta y
        \]
        for some real numbers $a$ and $b$.
        <span class="fragment">This should remind you of a dot product.</span>

    <h3>The linear approximation</h3>
    <p>
        From the view point of approximation,
        the condition of differentiability can also be understood as
        the condition that 
        \[
            f( x + \Delta x, y + \Delta y ) 
            \approx
            f( x, y ) + J(\Delta x,\Delta y)
        \]
        as $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ become sufficiently small.
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                This approximation should remind you of the
                "linear approximation" formula for function in one variable
                \[
                    f(x + \Delta x) \approx f(x) + f'(x) \Delta x.
                \]
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
                So, here, the linear map $J$
                plays the role of the multiplication by the derivative.

                Can visualize that,
                if we fix $x$ and $y$ and allow $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$
                to vary, the function
                \[
                    f( x, y ) + J(\Delta x,\Delta y)
                \]

    <h3>Differentiability is a stronger condition</h3>
    <p>
        The concept of differentiability we just defined
        is a strictly "stronger" condition than the existence of partial derivatives
        in the sense that being differentiable implies the
        existence of partial derivatives.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
        Let $f$ be a function in the $n$ variables.
        If $f$ is differentiable,
        then all its partial derivatives exist.
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        The converse is not true.
        We have seen non-differentiable functions 
        that have all partial derivatives.
        But with the additional condition of continuity of partial derivatives,
        differentiability can be established.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem fragment">
        Suppose $f$ be a function in $n$ variables $x_1,\dots,x_n$,
        and $\mathbf{p}_0$ is a point in the interior of its domain.
        If the partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}$
        exists and is continuous at $\mathbf{p}_0$ for each $i$,
        then $f$ is differentiable at $\mathbf{p}_0$

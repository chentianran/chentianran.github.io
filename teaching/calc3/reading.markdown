# {{ page.title }}

- Week 1:
  - Section 11.1:
    This section covers the basic of vectors in the plane
    including their representations and familiar algebraic operations.
  - Section 11.2:
    This section extends the discussions from the previous section
    to the 3-dimensional space.
  - Section 11.3:
    This section introduces a very important operation between vectors
    --- the dot product,
    which is the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors
    as well as the cosine of the angle between them.
  - Section 11.4:
    This section introduces a new operation --- the cross product between two vectors.
    This operation produces another vector,
    and is another important building block for multi-variable calculus.
  - Section 11.5:
    Lines and planes in 3-dimensional space
    are given a detailed look here.
    These are less important in our discussion,
    but it is still important to be aware of the generalizations
    of the equations for lines into the 3-dimensional space.
  - Section 11.6:
    This section covers a more complicated topic
    --- representations for surfaces in the space.
- Week 2:
  - Section 12.1:
    This section introduces the concept of vector-valued (or point-valued) functions.
  - Section 12.2:
    This section explains how derivatives and integrals
    can be naturally generalized into this context.
  - Section 12.3:
    Velocity and acceleration vectors are studied here.
  - Section 12.4:
    This section defines two important vectors associated with a point
    on the image of a vector-valued (or point-valued) function
    --- the unit tangent vector and the principal unit normal vector.
    Note that this is a difficult section.
- Week 3:
  - Revisit section 12.4.
  - Section 12.5:
    This section reviews the concept of arc-length
    and introduces the concept of arc-length parameter.
- Week 4:
  - Section 13.1:
    This section provides a broad overview of
    (real-valued) functions in several variables.
    Pay close attention to the new concepts introduced here.
  - Section 13.2:
    This section shows you how the concept of limits and continuity
    can be generalized to this new context.
- Week 5:
  - Revisit the subsection titled
    _Summary of Velocity, Acceleration, and Curvature_
    at the end of section 12.5.
    Make sure you have a solid understanding of all the vectors and scalars
    involved in those equations.
  - Section 13.3:
    This section introduces the concept of partial derivatives.
    They will be the basic tools with which we do calculus.
- Week 6:
  - Review Chapter 12.
  - Revisit section 13.3 and focus on
    higher order partial derivatives
    especially 2nd order partial derivative
    including mixed partials.
- Week 7:
  - Section 13.4:
    This section introduces two important concepts:
    differentials and differentiability.
    First, we should prioritize the concept of differentiability.
    Please carefully consider the subtlety in the definition of differentiability.
    It is much more complex than its 1-dimensional counterpart.

        The definition for functions of more than one variable

                The definition for functions of two variables
                is quite similar to the definition for functions of one variable
                that we already studied.

                These functions can be visualized as mappings between
                the 2-dimensional plane and the 1-dimensional real line,
                and they naturally appear in many applications.
                We have to develop a few new tools 
                in order to do calculus with these functions.

                Functions of two variables can be describe by formulas.
                For example,
                \[
                    f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 + \sin(xy)
                \]
                is a function defined on the domain $D = \mathbb{R}^2$.
                When we plug in a pair of real numbers $(x,y)$,
                this function produces a real number $z = f(x,y)$ as its output.

    <h3>Graphs of functions in two variables</h3>
    <p>
        For a given function $f(x,y)$ in the two variables $x$ and $y$,
        the set of points $(x,y,f(x,y))$ with $(x,y)$ in its domain
        is called the <em class="term">graph</em> of $f$.
    </p>
    <div class="cols fragment">
        <div class="col">
            <p>
                In other words, the function value $f(x,y)$ provides the $z$ value
                of any point in the graph of $f$.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the following image shows the surface
                that is the graph of the function
                \[
                    f(x,y) = \frac{x^2}{10} - \frac{y^2}{10} + \sin(xy).

    <h3>Contour lines and level curves</h3>
    <p>
        Visualizing a surface in space is not always easy.
        We often have to rely on their 2-dimensional representations
        similar to topographical maps.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        A topographical map use <em class="term">contour lines</em>
        to represent terrains that are not flat.
        They represent points having the exact same elevation.
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                In our context, the curves equivalent to <em>contour lines</em>
                are called <em class="term">level curves</em>.
            </p>
            <div class="definition fragment">
                For a function $f(x,y)$ and a number $c$ in its range,
                a <b class="term">level curve</b> of $f$
                at value $c$ is the set of all points $(x,y)$
                such that $f(x,y) = c$.
            </div>
        </div>

            <img src="cup.png" alt="">
            <p class="fragment small">
                It is also the intersection between
                the graph of $f$ and a plane defined by $z=c$.

    <h3>An simple example</h3>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col">
            <p>
                For the function
                \[ f(x,y) = \frac{x^2+y^2}{5}, \]
                and a nonnegative real number $c$,
                the level curve at value $c$
                is simply the curve defined by
                \[ \frac{x^2+y^2}{5} = c. \]
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <img src="cup-level.png" alt="">
            <p>
                We can see the level curves
                at values $c=1$ and $c=2$.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        In this figure,
        we can also see that the level curves are projection
        of points having the same "height"
        (just like in a topographical map).

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col">
            <div class="problem">
                Consider the function
                \[ f(x,y) = xy. \]
                Sketch the level curves at values
                $0,1,2,3,-1,-2,-3$ respectively.
            </div>

        <div class="col">
            <div class="problem">
                Consider the function
                \[ f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2. \]
                Sketch the level curves at values
                $0,1,2,3,-1,-2,-3$ respectively.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        While it is easy to sketch these level curves
        using computer programs (or graphing calculators),
        you should at least try to do these by hand, at least once.

    <h3>Functions of several variables</h3>

        Everything we just described can be easily generalized to
        functions of more than two variables.

        Given a positive integer $n$ and a subset $D$ of the $\mathbb{R}^n$,

        to a unique real number.
        <p class="fragment">

            that has at least one point $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ in $D$

    <h3>Level surface and level set</h3>
    <p>
        We can generalize the concept of level curves
        to functions in three variables,
        and the resulting objects are called <em class="term">level surface</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="definition fragment">
        Given a function $f(x,y,z)$ and a real number $c$
        in the range of $f$,
        a <b class="term">level surface</b> of $f$
        is the set of all points satisfying the equation $f(x,y,z) = c$.
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        We can generalize this idea much further to
        functions in $n$ variables,
        and the equivalent objects will be called <b class="term">level sets</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment small">
        Terms like level <em>curve</em> and level <em>surface</em>
        are not to be taken literally.
        It is possible for a level curve to not be a curve at all,
        and it is possible for a level surface to not be surface
        in the normal sense of the word.
        For example, we can see that the level curve of $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$
        defined by $f(x,y) = 0$ consists of a single point.

        For the function

        $f(x,y,z) = c$ for any $c$ in its range.

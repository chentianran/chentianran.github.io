    <h3>Vectors</h3>
    <p>
        In many applications, we need to manipulate quantities
        that contain not only magnitude (how big) but also direction (which way) information.
        Familiar examples of such quantities include force, velocity, and acceleration.
        In mathematics, these are captured by the abstract concept of "vectors".

                A "<em>directed</em>" line segment is 
                simply a line segment with an assigned direction.
                The two end points are called its
                <b class="term">initial point</b> and
                <b class="term">terminal point</b>  respectively,
                and we usually draw an arrowhead from the initial point
                to the terminal point to indicate the <em class="term">direction</em>.

        In mathematics, it is most common to use lowercase boldface letters
        for names of vectors (e.g. $\mathbf{v}$ or $\mathbf{u}$).
        When it is difficult to simulate boldface types,
        we often use small arrowhead over lowercase letters
        (e.g. $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{u}$).

    <h3>The zero vector</h3>

    <p>
        In order to be able to carry out computation with vectors,
        it is also necessary to include a special vector
        that has zero magnitude --- the "zero vector".
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col definition fragment">
            The <b class="term">zero vector</b>
            is the unique vector with zero magnitude and no direction.
        </div>
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                The zero vector is the only vector that has no assigned direction,
                and it is usually represent by a single point.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        It is usually denoted by $\mathbf{0}$ (the boldface 0).
        Alternatively, we can use the notation $\vec{0}$
        if boldface type is difficult to simulate.
        Whichever notation we use, we must distinguish it from 0 (the number)
        as they are very different.
        <!-- In the plane, we usually represent the zero vector
        with a single point, when necessary (without arrowhead). -->

    <h3>Equivalent vectors</h3>
    <p>
        Even though we represent vectors by directed line segment,
        it is important to understand vectors are not "attached" to points.
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col fragment">
            <div class="definition">
                Two vectors are said to be <b class="term">equivalent</b>
                if they have the same magnitude and direction.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                In other words, in the representation of a vector,
                the initial and terminal points are not important.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        Only its magnitude (length) and direction are important,
        and you are free to draw it anywhere you like
        as long as these two properties are preserved.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        For two equivalent vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{u}$,
        we write $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u}$.

    <h3>Scalars vs. vectors</h3>

    <p>
        In calculations, vectors often interact with numbers (real numbers),
        so it crucial to distinguish these two classes of objects.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        In our context, we also call a real number a <b class="term">scalar</b>
        to emphasize this important distinction.
        Essentially, a scalar has a magnitude, but no direction.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        For example, the velocity of an object is a vector,
        but its speed is a scalar.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        We usually use regular (non-boldface) lowercase letters
        for names scalar quantities 
        (but the distinction should always be clear from the context).

    <h3>Magnitude of vectors and unit vectors</h3>

    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col">
            <p>
                For a vector $\mathbf{v}$ in the plane,
                its <em class="term">magnitude</em> is denoted by
                $\| \mathbf{v} \|$,
                and it is a <em>nonnegative</em> real number.

        <div class="col">
            <p class="fragment">
                Indeed, the zero vector $\mathbf{0}$
                is the only vector with 0 magnitude.
                All other vectors have positive magnitude.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        In certain context, the magnitude of a vector
        is also known as its <b class="term">norm</b>.

    <div class="definition fragment">
        A <b class="term">unit vector</b> is 
        a vector whose magnitude is 1.
    </div>
    <p class="fragment small lowlight">
        There are infinitely many unit vectors.
        Indeed, picking any point on the unit circle (centered at the origin),
        the directed line segment from origin to this point
        gives us a unit vector.
        Of course, there are infinitely many such vectors.

    <h3>Working in a coordinate system</h3>
    <p>
        When carrying out computation involving vectors in a plane,
        it is much preferred to work in a coordinate system.
        There are many coordinate systems.
        The <em class="term">Cartesian coordinate system</em> 
        is the most straightforward one,
        and we will work within this system for most of the lectures in this course.
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                Since a vector can be "placed" anywhere,
                we can always move it so that its initial point is the origin.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                Once in this position,
                we can use the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the terminal point to represent this vector.

    <div class="cols">

            <p>
                If a vector has original as its initial point
                and the point $(x,y)$ as its terminal point,
                then we can use the pair of number $x,y$ to represent it.

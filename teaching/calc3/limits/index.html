        The concepts of limits and continuity
        form the foundation of differential calculus.
        In this lecture, we will develop these concepts
        in the context of real-valued functions of several variables.

    <h3>Notations</h3>
    <p>
        Much of what we will discuss here apply equally well to
        2-dimensional, 3-dimensional spaces, or even higher-dimensional spaces.
        Therefore, we will directly talk about functions of $n$ variables
        defined on subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

                Throughout our discussions, 
                we will use the boldface symbol for ordered list of $n$ variables,
                i.e., we will write
                \[
                    \mathbf{x} = (x_1,\dots,x_n).
                \]

                We also make frequent use of the <em class="term">distance function</em>
                for $n$-dimensional spaces,
                which is given by the familiar distance formula (Pythagorean Theorem).

                we define
                \[
                    d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) =
                    \sqrt{ (x_1-y_1)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - y_n)^n }.

    <h3>Limits</h3>
    <p>
        With minor modifications,
        the concept of limits can be directly generalized to
        functions of several variables.
    </p>
    <div class="definition fragment">
        Suppose $f$ is a real-valued function of $n$ variables.
        We say the <b class="term">limit</b> of $f$
        as $\mathbf{x}$ approaches $\mathbf{z}$ is $L$
        and write
        \[ \lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{z}} f(\mathbf{x}) = L \]
        if for any real number $\epsilon > 0$, 
        there exists a real number $\delta >0$ s.t.
        \[
            0 < d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) < \delta
            \;\text{implies}\;
            |f(\mathbf{x}) - L| < \epsilon.
        \]
    </div>
    <p class="small lowlight fragment">
        Here, we are assuming $f$ is defined in an "neighborhood"
        around $\mathbf{z}$, but it may or may not be defined at $\mathbf{z}$.
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col">
            <p class="fragment">
                Of course, if no such real number $L$ exists, we say
                $\lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{z}} f(\mathbf{x})$ does not exist
                (or undefined).
            </p>

        <div class="col">
            <p class="fragment">
                When the limit exists, familiar "laws" of limits 
                we learned earlier remain valid.

    <h3>When limits fail to exist</h3>
    <p>
        It is important to notice that for $n > 1$,
        limits of a real-valued function in $n$ variables
        may fail to exist for some new reasons.
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                For $n > 1$, there are actually infinitely many directions
                from which we can approach a point $\mathbf{z}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
                If the limit exists, it must be independent from the direction.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col fragment">
            <div class="problem">
                Show the limit
                \[
                    \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{ xy }{x^2 + y^2}
                \]
                does not exist.

        It may be helpful to plot the graph of this function
        near the origin $(0,0)$ to see exactly what the problem is.

    <h3>Continuity</h3>
    <p>
        Just like in the calculus of functions in one variable,
        we can define the concept of continuity for functions of several variables
        in terms of limits.
    </p>
    <div class="definition fragment">
        For a real-valued function $f(\mathbf{x})$ of $n$ variables,
        we say $f$ is <b class="term">continuous</b> at $\mathbf{z}$ if
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    $f(\mathbf{z})$ is defined, i.e., $z$ is in the domain of $f$;
                </li>
                <li>
                    $\lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{z}} f(\mathbf{x})$ exists (and is finite); and
                </li>
                <li>
                    $\lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{z}} f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{z})$.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="fragment">
        In other words, a function being continuous at a point
        means its function value and limit at this point are both defined
        and they are the same.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        This concept <em>mostly</em> agrees our intuition:
        at a point where a function is continuous,
        the graph of the function has no gaps and holes.

                are still continuous.

                Notice that we did not include quotients of 
                continuous functions in several variables in this list.
                In general, the quotient of two continuous functions
                may not be continuous.

        Of course, for function compositions,
        we need to make sure they actually make sense.
        That is, if $g$ is a real-valued functions in $n$ variables,
        the composition $f(g(x_1,\ldots,x_n))$ only makes sense if
        $f$ is a function in one variable.

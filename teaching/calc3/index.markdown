## How to survive this course?

* Read before class
  - Reading is an important component in our learning process.
  - Reading assignment are listed in the course schedule
    (to be finished __before__ class)
* Read your quizzes and the solution sheets
  - You should understand why your answers are wrong (or why they are right)
  - If you see the same questions again in the future, will you make the same mistakes?
* Participate!
  - You are not a passive note-taking robot
  - Let's think together!
  - Participate in in-class discussion (your participation will be graded)
  - Participate in online   discussion (your participation will be graded)
* Tell yourself that it is okay to not know the correct answer
  - ...well, as long as you are actively trying to figure out the answers
  - the process of the trying to figure out the answer is the important part.
    The only important part!

## Misc.

* Definition: _A __lecture__ is a process in which information passes
  from the notes of the lecturer into the notes of the student
  without passing through the minds of either._
  Funny, but true.
  But it really shouldn't be.
  Let's make sure our lectures are not like that.

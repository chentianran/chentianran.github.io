# MATH-2630

This is the third course in the standard calculus sequence.
In this course, we embark on an exciting journey
beyond the boundaries of single-variable calculus
to explore the intricacies of functions of multiple variables.
Our focus will shift from the limitations of
two-dimensional graphs to the dynamic landscapes of three dimensions and beyond.
With multi-variable calculus,
we equip ourselves with the tools to understand and analyze
the world in a richer, more comprehensive way.
Prepare to unlock the new dimensions!

<!-- ## How to survive this course?

* Read before class
  - Reading is an important component in our learning process.
  - Reading assignment are listed in the course schedule
    (to be finished __before__ class)
  - Complete reading tests (see our course Blackboard)
* Participate!
  - You are not a passive note-taking robot
  - Let's think together!
  - Participate in in-class discussion
  - Participate in online   discussion
* Tell yourself that it is okay to not know the correct answer
  - ...well, as long as you are actively trying to figure out the answers
  - the process of the trying to figure out the answer is the important part.
    The only important part! -->

## Additional material

* [Vectors](vectors/)
* [Sum of vectors](vectorsum/)
* [Dot product of vectors](dotprod/)
* [Cross product of vectors](crossprod/)
* [Matrix-vector product](matvec/)
* [Matrix determinant](det/)
* [Contour plots](contour/)

<!-- ## Misc.

* Definition: _A __lecture__ is a process in which information passes
  from the notes of the lecturer into the notes of the student
  without passing through the minds of either._
  Funny, but true.
  But it really shouldn't be.
  Let's make sure our lectures are not like that. -->

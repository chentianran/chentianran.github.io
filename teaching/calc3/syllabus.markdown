My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

Multivariable calculus is a fundamental pillar for modern science and engineering:

- It extends single variable calculus to higher dimensions as if we are
  putting on 3D glasses.
  It turns out the higher dimensional structures are much richer than in the
  single variable cases, and many familiar concepts and theorems have much more
  interesting generalizations.

- It provides the basic vocabulary for mathematical descriptions of
  fundamental processes and phenomena..

- It forms the basic building blocks for geometrical objects like curves,
  surfaces, solids, and even higher dimensional analogs

- It develops intuition needed in other fields like linear algebra or data analysis.

- It prepares you for further study in many other fields
  (not only in mathematics and its direct applications)

- It makes you smarter (... I hope).

This is the third course in the calculus sequence.
We will extend calculus to functions with more than one variables.
In particular, we will cover...

* Coordinate systems for 3-dimensional spaces
* Basic algebra using vectors and matrices
* Calculus of functions in multiple variables
* Calculus of vector-valued functions and vector fields
* Geometry of space curves
* Geometry of curved surfaces
* Lagrange multipliers and optimization problems
* Double and triple integrals
* Line integrals
* Green's theorem
* (Optional) Stokes' and Gauss's theorems

### Prerequisite

In order to succeed in this class, a solid understanding of basic calculus is necessary.
These prerequisite can be satisfied by MATH-1610
or an appropriate score in the AUM Math Placement Test.

### Textbook

- [Required] _Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (any edition) by Larson & Edwards
  (6th edition ISBN: 978-1285774770)
- [Optional] _Calculus_ by Gilbert Strang (PDF version is _free_!)
    * [One single big PDF file](http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/Strang/Edited/Calculus/Calculus.pdf)
    * [PDF files by chapters](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/)
    * [A few great video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/highlights_of_calculus/big-picture-of-calculus/)

Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from these textbook.

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore class attendance is expected.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
According to AUM Mathematics Department Calculator Policy,
students are required to have a graphing calculator
(TI-84 is recommended).
The use of such calculators may be required for certain homework problems
or in-class activities.
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities
are not allowed on any of the quizzes and exams.

### Weekly quizzes

There will be a short quiz _every week_ to test
our understanding of the material discussed in the previous meetings.
__No makeup quiz will be offered__.
However, a missing quiz may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing quiz receives a score of zero.

### Projects
Projects are more complicated mathematical problems that will
guide you to gain deeper understanding of the material we learn in class.
They will be a major part of your course grade.

### Homework problems
Practice is a crucial component in the learning process.
Certain exercise problems will be assigned in class.

### Participation
Participation in in-class and online discussions is a crucially important
component of the learning process.
Your participation will be recorded and graded,
and it constitutes a major part of your course grade.

### Final exam
The mandatory final exam is scheduled at __11:00am---12:00pm Dec. 6.__
If you miss the final exam, your grade will be FA.

### Grade composition
Your final grade is determined according to your overall performance of quizzes,
the in-class worksheets, projects, and the final exam,
and is calculated according to the following weights.

| Component   | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Quizzes     |  140   |
| Discussions |  250   |
| Projects    |  550   |
| Final Exam  |   60   |

### Grading scale

* A: 90% - 100%
* B: 80% - 89.9%
* C: 70% - 79.9%
* D: 60% - 69.9%
* F: below 60%

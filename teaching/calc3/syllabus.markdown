My job is to help you to succeed in this class.
I will be happy to discuss issues related to this course
(or anything mathematical) in person or via email.
In addition to the normal office hours listed above,
alternative meeting time may be arranged
(please give me at least 48hr advanced notice).

### What we will learn

Multivariable calculus is a fundamental pillar for modern science and engineering:

- It extends single variable calculus to higher dimensions as if we are
  putting on 3D glasses.
  It turns out the higher dimensional structures are much richer than in the
  single variable cases, and many familiar concepts and theorems have much more
  interesting generalizations.

- It provides the basic vocabulary for mathematical descriptions of
  fundamental processes and phenomena.

- It forms the basic building blocks for geometrical objects like curves,
  surfaces, solids, and even higher dimensional analogs.

- It develops intuition needed in other fields like linear algebra or data analysis.

- It prepares you for further study in many other fields
  (not only in mathematics and its direct applications).

This is the third course in the calculus sequence.
We will extend calculus to functions with more than one variable.
In particular, we will cover...

* Coordinate systems for 3-dimensional spaces
* Basic algebra using vectors and matrices
* Calculus of functions in multiple variables
* Calculus of vector-valued functions and vector fields
* Geometry of space curves
* Geometry of curved surfaces
* Lagrange multipliers and optimization problems
* Double and triple integrals
* Line integrals
* Green's theorem
* (Optional) Stokes' and Gauss's theorems
* (Optional) Fourier transformation and DCT

### Prerequisite

In order to succeed in this class, a solid understanding of basic calculus is necessary.
These prerequisite can be satisfied by MATH-1610 and MATH-1620
(or an appropriate score in the AUM Math Placement Test).

### Textbook

- [Required] _Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ (7th edition) by Larson & Edwards
  ISBN: 9781337552516
- [Optional] _Calculus_ by Gilbert Strang (PDF version is _free_!)
    * [One single big PDF file](http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/Strang/Edited/Calculus/Calculus.pdf)
    * [PDF files by chapters](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/)
    * [A few great video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/highlights_of_calculus/big-picture-of-calculus/)

<!-- Reading assignment and homework problems will be assigned from these textbook. -->

### Attendance and participation

Participation in in-class discussions and activities is an important part
of the learning process.
Therefore, class attendance is expected.
_Students missing 6 or more classes without an approved excuse
will receive an F grade_.

### Code of conduct

Please be respectful of other people in the classroom and use common sense.
In particular, please...

* __DO NOT__ use cell phones
* __DO NOT__ use social media
* __DO NOT__ take photos without permission
* __DO NOT__ sleep

Students who violate these rules will be asked to leave the classroom
and will not be allowed to return until they have spoken privately with me.

### Policy for calculators and smart devices

Scientific calculators or equivalent software programs can be helpful in
doing homework problems.
According to AUM Mathematics Department Calculator Policy,
students are required to have a graphing calculator
(TI-84 is recommended).
The use of such calculators may be required for certain homework problems
or in-class activities.
However, all the quizzes and exams are designed so that no calculator will be needed.
Therefore, calculators or any smart devices with Internet capabilities
are not allowed on any of the in-class quizzes and exams.

<!-- ### Daily reading tests

After reading the textbook, you need to complete a short reading test
through the Blackboard system.
On average, there are two reading tests due each week.
__No late submission will be accepted__.
However, a missing reading test may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing reading test receives a score of zero.
It is recommended that you finish the reading test at least a few days
before the due date.

Each reading test allows multiple attempts.
Please see the test descriptions on the Blackboard system for detail. -->

<!-- ### Concept tests

You will need to complete short online tests on the Blackboard system
that are designed to test your overall understanding of the subject.
All concepts tests are due on the last day of classes,
and __no late submission will be accepted__.
However, it is strongly recommended that you complete them as early as possible. -->

### In-class quizzes

There will be a weekly in-class quiz to test our understanding of the material covered in previous meetings. If you miss a quiz, you can make it up at the end of the semester with valid reasons (such as military assignments, medical issues, or family emergencies) and proper documentation provided in advance. Otherwise, a missed quiz will receive a score of zero.

### In-class "continuous assessment" worksheets

In-class practice is a crucial component of the learning process. You will receive weekly assessment tests, which will be recorded and contribute to your grade. However, the tests themselves are not graded.
(That is, you earn points just by taking them regardless how well you do in them)

### Reading assignment

Reading the textbook is crucial for comprehending complex concepts, gaining deep insights, and establishing a solid foundation for acquiring advanced mathematical skills. Hence, it is expected that you read the textbook attentively. Weekly reading assessments will be conducted and will contribute to your overall grade.

### Exercise problems

Exercise problems included in our textbook are vital for
understanding the subject.
They provide practical applications of theory,
reinforcing learning and testing comprehension.
Exercises identify areas of difficulty,
encourage further study and enhance problem-solving skills.
You are strongly encouraged to try out as many exercise problems
as possible.

### Projects

Projects in this course are intended to facilitate your exploration of its deeper aspects and will significantly contribute to your final grade. In the latter half of the semester, you will be given a selection of topics to choose from.

<!-- ### Weekly homework assignments

Homework problems are more complicated mathematical problems that will
guide you to gain deeper understanding of the material we learn in class.
They will be a major part of your course grade.
Homework problems are listed on our Blackboard system,
and _they must be submitted via the Blackboard system_.
__No late homework submission will be accepted__
However, a missing homework assignment may be excused if valid reasons
(military assignments, medical issues, family emergency, etc)
and _proper documentation_ are provided _in advance_.
Otherwise, a missing homework assignment receives a score of zero. -->

### Final exam

The final exam is scheduled at __10:45am---12:15pm Apr. 25__.

    <h3>Scalar multiplication</h3>
    <p>
        Recall that in the context of this course,
        a <em class="term">scalar</em> is simply a real number. 
        We can multiply a vector by a scalar --- the "scalar multiplication".

    <div class="definition fragment">
        For a scalar $k$ and a vector $\mathbf{v}$,
        the <b class="term">scalar multiplication</b> (product)
        of the two, denoted by $k \, \mathbf{v}$,
        as the vector whose magnitude is $|k|$ times the magnitude of $\mathbf{v}$ itself
        and has a direction that is the same as the direction of $\mathbf{v}$ if $k>0$
        or the opposite direction if $k < 0$.

                E.g., $3 \mathbf{v}$ is exactly 3 times as long as $\mathbf{v}$ itself.
                By extension, $0 \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$.

    <h3>Scalar multiplication in coordinates</h3>

        It should come as no surprise that, in coordinate,
        \[
            k \,

    <h3>Normalization</h3>
    <p>
        One important operation defined in terms of scalar multiplication

    <h3>Sum of vectors</h3>
    <p>
        We can also add two vectors together,
        and the sum is also a vector.
    </p>
    <div class="theoremlike fragment" data-type="Parallelogram interpretation">
        Let $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ be two vectors
        represented by two directed line segments sharing the same initial point.
        Then the diagonal of the parallelogram spanned by $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$
        together with the same initial point represents the sum $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}$.

    <p class="fragment">
        Equivalently, we can also place the initial point of $\mathbf{v}$

        that goes from the initial point of $\mathbf{u}$ to the terminal point of $\mathbf{v}$.

    <h3>Difference of vectors in coordinates</h3>
    <p>
        As expected, we can define the difference of two vectors
        in terms of vector sum and additive inverse.
    </p>
    <div class="definition">
        For two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$,
        we define

    <h3>Properties of vector sums/differences</h3>
    <p>
        Vectors form a new kind of mathematical object

        Fortunately, some familiar algebraic properties remain true.

                From the geometric interpretation,

                    \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} &= \mathbf{v} \\
                    \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{0} &= \mathbf{v} \\

            <p>
                Once we understand the geometric interpretation of vector sums,

    <h3>Triangle inequality</h3>
    <p>
        From the graphical interpretations of vector sums,
        it is easy to come up with an upper bound for the
        magnitude of the sum of two vectors
        in terms of the magnitude of the two individual vectors.

    <div class="theorem">
        For two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$,

    <h3>Scalar multiplication and vector addition</h3>

        From the formula for vector addition in coordinate,
        it is not hard to verify the following algebraic properties
        \begin{align*}
            k (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) &= (k \, \mathbf{u}) + (k \, \mathbf{v}) \\
            (k_1 \mathbf{v}) + (k_2 \mathbf{v}) &= (k_1 + k_2) \, \mathbf{v} \\
            k_1 (k_2 \mathbf{v}) &= (k_1 k_2) \, \mathbf{v} \\
            0 \, \mathbf{v} &= \mathbf{0} \\

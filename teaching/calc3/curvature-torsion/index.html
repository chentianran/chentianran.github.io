                As before, throughout this discussion, 
                we will use the notation
                \[
                    \mathbf{r}(t) =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        x(t) \\ y(t) \\ z(t)
                    \end{bmatrix}
                \]
                to represent a vector-value function.
                For simplicity, we assume it is defined and differentiable for all $t$
                (over the entire real line).

            <p class="fragment">
                To appeal to our intuition,
                it may be useful to consider $t$ as <em>time</em>
                and imagine the function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ describe the trajectory
                of an object moving in space.

                Recall that, for any given $t$ value such that

                <em class="term">(principal) unit tangent vector</em> is

    <h3>Curvature</h3>
    <p>
        The concept of "curvature" provides a numerical quantity
        that can measure how sharply a smooth curve turns.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        It agrees with our intuition:
        a straight line has 0 curvature,
        and a circle has a constant curvature, 
        which depends on the radius.
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col">
            <div class="definition fragment">
                (Alternative)
                at a $t$ value where $\mathbf{T}'(t)$ and $\mathbf{r}'(t)$
                are both defined and $\| \mathbf{r}'(t) \| \ne 0$,
                the <b class="term">curvature</b> of the curve represented by $\mathbf{r}(t)$
                is given by
                \[
                    \kappa =
                    \frac{\| \mathbf{T}'(t) \|}{ \| \mathbf{r}'(t) \|}.

                This is really an "alternative" working definition,
                and it has the problem that it is undefined
                whenever $\mathbf{r}'(t) = \mathbf{0}$.
                We will see a more elegant (but less useful)
                definition of $\kappa$ in term of arc-length parametrization.

    <h3>Alternative curvature formula as a cross product</h3>
    <p>
        Using the properties of the unit tangent vector,
        we can see that the curvature can also be computed as
        \[
            \kappa = 
            \frac{ \| \mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t) \| }{ \| \mathbf{r}'(t) \|^3 },
        \]
        which is usually much easier to compute.
    </p>
    <div class="example fragment">
        Compute the curvature of the curve represented by
        $\mathbf{r}(t) = a \cos(t) \mathbf{i} + a \sin(t) \mathbf{j} + 0 \mathbf{k}$,
        for $a > 0$, at any given $t$ value.
    </div>
    <p class="small fragment">
        <b>Solution.</b>
        We can compute that 
        \begin{align*}
            \mathbf{r}'(t) &= -a\sin(t) \mathbf{i} + a\cos(t) \mathbf{j}, &
            \mathbf{r}''(t) &= - a \cos(t) \mathbf{i} - a \sin(t) \mathbf{j}.
        \end{align*}
        <span class="fragment">Therefore, $\| \mathbf{r}'(t) \| = a$.</span>
        <span class="fragment">
            Moreover,
            \[
                \mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t) =
                a^2(\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t)) \mathbf{k} = a^2 \, \mathbf{k},
            \]
            and hence $\| \mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t) \| = a^2$.
            So $\kappa = a^2 / a^3 = 1/a$, which agrees with our intuition
            (smaller the circle, higher the curvature).

    <h3>Curvature of circles and straight lines</h3>
    <p>
        Of course, what we just computed generalizes to any circles.
        In general, a circle of radius $a$ has a constant curvature
        of $\frac{1}{a}$.
        <span class="fragment">
            This agrees with our intuition that 
            a smaller circle has large curvature,
            while a large circle has small curvature.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        From our working definition, 
        $\kappa = \frac{ \| \mathbf{T}'(t) \| }{ \| \mathbf{r}'(t) \| }$,
        we can also easily verify that all straight lines have
        zero curvature, as expected.

    <h3>Osculating circle</h3>
    <div class="definition">
        At any given $t$ value, where $\mathbf{T}(t)$ and $\mathbf{N}(t)$
        are both defined, the plane spanned by these two vectors

        the curve traced out by $\mathbf{r}(t)$.
        <p class="fragment">
            In this plane, a circle that is tangent to the curve
            at $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{r}(t)$ and has the same curvature is called an

    <h3>Decomposition of acceleration vector</h3>
    <p>
        Recall that, if we consider $\mathbf{r}(t)$ to represent the
        trajectory of a moving object,
        then its acceleration at any point of time
        can be decomposed into the <em class="term">tangential component</em>
        and the <em class="term">normal component</em>.
        Curvature helps us to describe the normal component.
    </p>
    <div class="theorem fragment">
        The acceleration vector $\mathbf{r}''(t)$ of the object,
        whose trajectory is represented by $\mathbf{r}(t)$, 
        at a given time $t$ lies in the plane spanned by 
        the unit tangent vector $\mathbf{T}(t)$ and 
        the principal unit normal vector $\mathbf{N}(t)$.
        <span class="fragment">
            Moreover,
            <span data-id="ctn">
                \[
                    \mathbf{r}''(t) =

                \]
            </span>
            where $v(t) = \| \mathbf{r}'(t) \|$ is the <em>speed</em> of the object
            and $\kappa(t)$ is the curvature of the curve traced out by this object
            at that moment.
        </span>
    </div>
    <p class="smaller lowlight fragment">
        (Here, we have a slight abuse of notation:
        We express the curvature $\kappa(t)$ as a function of time $t$
        since we want to describe how an object moves.
        But you should keep in mind that $\kappa$ is actually a property
        of the curve itself.)

    <h3>Rotation of the osculating plane</h3>
    <p>
        By considering $\mathbf{T}'(t)$,
        we developed the concept of curvature.
        Now we will consider $\mathbf{B}'(t)$,
        which characterizes the rotation of the osculating plane itself,
        and we will develop the concept of torsion from this.
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
        Since $\mathbf{B}(t) = \mathbf{T}(t) \times \mathbf{N}(t)$,
        by the product rule,
        \[
            \mathbf{B}'
            = \mathbf{T}' \times \mathbf{N} + \mathbf{T} \times \mathbf{N}'
            = \mathbf{T}' \times \frac{\mathbf{T}'}{ \| \mathbf{T}' \| } + \mathbf{T} \times \mathbf{N}'
            = \mathbf{T} \times \mathbf{N}'.
        \]
        <span class="fragment">
            Therefore, $\mathbf{B}'(t)$ must be orthogonal to $\mathbf{T}(t)$.
            <span class="smaller lowlight">(That's how cross product works)</span>
        </span>
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                Also recall that $\mathbf{B}(t)$ is always a unit vector,
                so its derivative $\mathbf{B}'(t)$ must be orthogonal to $\mathbf{B}(t)$ itself.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
                That is, $\mathbf{B}'(t)$ is orthogonal to both
                $\mathbf{T}(t)$ and $\mathbf{B}(t)$.

        </div>
        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                Therefore, $\mathbf{B}'(t)$ must be parallel to $\mathbf{N}(t)$.
                That is, $\mathbf{B}'(t)$ must be a multiple of $\mathbf{N}(t)$,
                and the coefficient describe how fast and in which direction
                is the osculating plane rotating about the $\mathbf{N}(t)$.

    <h3>Torsion</h3>
    <p>
        So far, through some vector algebra,
        we understood that $\mathbf{B}'(t)$ must be a multiple of $\mathbf{N}(t)$.
        We can visualize this coefficient as a description
        of how fast and in which direction
        is the osculating plane rotating about the $\mathbf{N}(t)$.
        This leads to the concept of torsion.
    </p>
    <div class="cols">
        <div class="col fragment">
            <div class="definition">
                If $\| \mathbf{r}'(t) \| = 1$,
                then we define the <b class="term">torsion</b>
                of the curve represented by $\mathbf{r}$ at a given point to be
                \[
                    \tau = - \mathbf{B}'(t) \cdot \mathbf{N}(t).

        <div class="col fragment">
            <p>
                In the more general case where $\| \mathbf{r}'(t) \|$ may not be 1,
                we have the alternative formula
                \[
                    \tau =
                    \frac{ \det [ \mathbf{r}', \mathbf{r}'', \mathbf{r}''' ] }{ \| \mathbf{r}' \times \mathbf{r}'' \|^2 }
                \]
                <!-- using scalar triple product. -->

    <p class="fragment">
        Comparing the two formula,
        we can see that the condition $\| \mathbf{r}'(t) \| = 1$
        produces much more elegant formula.

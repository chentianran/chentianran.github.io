The following problems will guide you to gain deeper understanding of the
key concepts in this course.
Please attempt as many problem as possible.
You can earn up to __20 points__ for each problem.
You must type your solutions and clearly label each problem
(ideally each problem should on a separate sheet of paper).

### Vectors

#### [a] Different concepts (Day 4)
Physicists and computer programmers all use the word "vector",
but they mean different things.
Explain what does the word mean in these two contexts.
How are they related to the mathematical meaning of that word?

#### [b] Length of a vector (Day 4)
How is the length (magnitude) of a vector $$(x,y,z)$$ is defined?
Why is it defined that way?

### Derivatives

#### [a] What is "directional derivative"

### Higher dimensional spheres

#### [a] Volume of a 4-dimensional unit sphere
A 4-dimensional sphere is the set of points in $$\mathbb{R}^4$$
whose distance from the origin is 1 or less.
Using multiple integrals, can you compute the volume of such a sphere?

#### [b] Volume of an n-dimensional unit sphere
As a natural generalizations of the previous part,
can you compute the volume of an $$n$$-dimensional unit sphere?

#### [c] As dimension increase...
Plot the volume of an $$n$$-dimensional unit sphere as function of the dimension
and observe the general trend.
What do you notice?
Do you have an intuitive explanation of this trend?
What would be the limit be as $$n \to \infty$$?

### Gravitational pull of the earth
To make the computation easy, let us assume the earth is a perfectly spherical
ball with a uniform density same as that of granite.
What is the gravitational pull experienced by a point mass of 1 kg
that is 1000 meters from the _surface_ of the earth?

### Hollow planet
Let's suppose there is planet that has a hollow core
(whether or not this is physically possible is a totally different question).
For simplicity let us assume this planet is actually a perfect spherical shell
(no mountains of valleys) of certain thickness and uniform density.
What kind of gravitational pull will a person inside the hollow planet experience?


### Planimeters

#### [a]
A _planimeter_ is a mechanical measuring device that could accurately compute
the areas of _arbitrary_ shapes.
In certain sense, it is a mechanical manifestation of the famous Green's theorem.
Explain how such a device could work (using Green's theorem).

#### [b]
[This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/zJYniqk2eEs),
shows a planimeter made from a spoon.
Does it really work? Why?


### Kepler's laws
Before the invention (or adoption?) of calculus, planetary motion
(how a planet would orbit the sun) was described using _Kepler's laws_.
What are these laws?
How can they be explained using multivariable calculus?

### Higher dimensional spheres

#### [a] Volume of a 4-dimensional unit sphere
A 4-dimensional sphere is the set of points in $$\mathbb{R}^4$$
whose distance from the origin is 1 or less.
Using multiple integrals, can you compute the volume of such a sphere?

#### [b] Volume of an n-dimensional unit sphere
As a natural generalizations of the previous part,
can you compute the volume of an $$n$$-dimensional unit sphere?

#### [c] As dimension increase...
Plot the volume of an $$n$$-dimensional unit sphere as function of the dimension
and observe the general trend.
What do you notice?
Do you have an intuitive explanation of this trend?
What would be the limit be as $$n \to \infty$$?


### Hollow planet
Let's suppose there is planet that has a hollow core
(whether or not this is physically possible is a totally different question).
For simplicity let us assume this planet is actually a perfect spherical shell
(no mountains of valleys) of certain thickness and uniform density.
What kind of gravitational pull will a person inside the hollow planet experience?


### Planimeters

#### [a]
A _planimeter_ is a mechanical measuring device that could accurately compute
the areas of _arbitrary_ shapes.
In certain sense, it is a mechanical manifestation of the famous Green's theorem.
Explain how such a device could work (using Green's theorem).

#### [b]
[This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/zJYniqk2eEs),
shows a planimeter made from a spoon.
Does it really work? Why?


### Kepler's laws
Before the invention (or adoption?) of calculus, planetary motion
(how a planet would orbit the sun) was described using _Kepler's laws_.
What are these laws?
How can they be explained using multivariable calculus?

  in regular class meeting time,
  use the link <https://calendly.com/chentianran/one-on-one>
  and reserve a 15 minute slot (or more).
* If you plan to join in-person meetings,
  please use the link
  <https://calendly.com/chentianran/in-person>
  to indicate that you will show up
  (so that I can keep attendance record more easily).

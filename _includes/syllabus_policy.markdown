**Academic dishonesty:**
Cheating of any kind will not be tolerated.
In particular, you cannot copy (totally or partially) someone else's solutions
or allow someone else to copy your solutions on quizzes or exams.
You will receive an "F" in the course if you are caught.
Please consult Student Handbook for additional guidelines.

**Disability accommodations:**
Students who need accommodations are asked to arrange a meeting
during office hours to discuss your accommodations.
If you have a conflict with my office hours, an alternate time can be arranged.
To set up this meeting, please contact me by e-mail.
If you have not registered for accommodation services through the
Center for Disability Services (CDS), but need accommodations,
make an appointment with CDS, 147 Taylor Center,
or call 334-244-3631 or e-mail CDS at <cds@aum.edu>

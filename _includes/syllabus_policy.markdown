**Social distancing guidelines**
Following the AUM social distancing and face covering policy,
all members (faculty and students) in this class must 
maintain social distancing at all time in an indoor classroom as follows:

* Stay at least 6 feet from other people
* Avoid unnecessary grouping and congregating of people
* Adhere to posted signage that regulates pedestrian traffic flow

Under AUM's COVID-19 Campus Health Policy,
all students must _wear face coverings_
(face masks, face shields, and any other covering
that is consistent with federal and state public health guidance)
during most campus activities, including during our in-person class sessions,
unless an exemption has been approved by the Dean of Students or the Center for Disability Services.
Students who violate these policies will be asked to leave the classroom to
access the lecture/course materials online and may be referred to the Office of the Dean of Students.

**Academic dishonesty:**
Cheating of any kind will not be tolerated.
In particular, you cannot copy (totally or partially) someone else's solutions
or allow someone else to copy your solutions on quizzes or exams.
You will receive an "F" in the course if you are caught.
Please consult Student Handbook for additional guidelines.

**Disability accommodations:**
Students who need accommodations are asked to arrange a meeting
during office hours to discuss your accommodations.
If you have a conflict with my office hours, an alternate time can be arranged.
To set up this meeting, please contact me by e-mail.
If you have not registered for accommodation services through the
Center for Disability Services (CDS), but need accommodations,
make an appointment with CDS, 147 Taylor Center,
or call 334-244-3631 or e-mail CDS at <cds@aum.edu>

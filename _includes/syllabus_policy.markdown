**AUM COVID-19 updates.**
Please follow guidelines detailed in the
[AUM pandemic plan](https://www.aum.edu/backtocampus)
relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<!-- **Social distancing guidelines**
Following the AUM social distancing and face covering policy,
all members (faculty and students) in this class must 
maintain social distancing at all time in an indoor classroom as follows:

* Stay at least 6 feet from other people
* Avoid unnecessary grouping and congregating of people
* Adhere to posted signage that regulates pedestrian traffic flow

Under AUM's COVID-19 Campus Health Policy,
all students must _wear face coverings_
(face masks, face shields, and any other covering
that is consistent with federal and state public health guidance)
during most campus activities, including during our in-person class sessions,
unless an exemption has been approved by the Dean of Students or the Center for Disability Services.
Students who violate these policies will be asked to leave the classroom to
access the lecture/course materials online and may be referred to the Office of the Dean of Students.

**Course attendance policy**
Students are expected to attend regular class meetings either
in-person or virtually.
After missing 6 class meetings, a student will receive an 'FA' grade.
However,

* Students who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or
  who are in self-quarantine at the direction of a health care professional
  should not attend a face-to-face (in-person) class.
* Students who have COVID-19 like symptoms
  should not attend a f2f class until the symptoms are gone and
  the student is cleared by a health professional that the student is COVID free.

Attendance in those two cases may be excused and arrangement,
can be made for students to complete missed work.
Such arrangements must be requested by students, -->

**Technology equipment expectation.**
Access to computers and stable Internet connection are expected.
Students who do not have their own equipment can use AUM open labs including labs found in the first floor of the Taylor center and the second floor of the library.

**Syllabus contingency plan.**
Should the Alabama Department of Public Health,
the Governor, or Chancellor determine the university discontinue
face-to-face (in-person) instruction in the interest of safety,
this course would be converted to a virtual-only format.
If normal class and/or lab activities are disrupted due to
illness, emergency, or crisis situation (such as a COVID-19 outbreak),
the syllabus and other course plans and assignments may be
modified to allow completion of the course.
If this occurs, an addendum to the syllabus and/or course assignments
will replace the original materials.

In case the instructor cannot attend due to COVID-related matter,
a back-up instructor will be arranged by the Department of Mathematics.

**Academic dishonesty.**
Cheating of any kind will not be tolerated.
In particular, you cannot copy (totally or partially) someone else's solutions
or allow someone else to copy your solutions on quizzes or exams.
If you do, you will receive an "F" in the course.
Please consult Student Handbook for additional guidelines.

**Disability accommodations.**
Students who need accommodations are asked to arrange a meeting
during office hours to discuss your accommodations.
If you have a conflict with my office hours, an alternate time can be arranged.
To set up this meeting, please contact me by e-mail.
If you have not registered for accommodation services through the
Center for Disability Services (CDS), but need accommodations,
make an appointment with CDS, 147 Taylor Center,

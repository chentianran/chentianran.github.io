### Are there no tests?

Correct. There will be no mid-term exams or final exams.

### What is a "flipped" course?

The term "flipped" refers the way how we (instructors and students)
spend our time is flipped in relation to how traditional
Instead of attending in-person lecture and then
work on homework assignments at home by yourself,
you will be watching/listening to lectures at home and then
work on "homework assignments with me.
That is, we will spend our meeting time (in-person or virtually)
mainly to work on problems together.

### When should I schedule one-on-one meetings?

You should schedule Zoom or in-person one-on-one meetings
in the regular class meeting periods.

### How to schedule a weekly Zoom meeting?

Use this link: <https://calendly.com/chentianran/one-on-one>
and reserve a 15 minutes slot.
Longer meetings may be possible, depending on how busy we are.

### Can I cancel or reschedule a meeting?

Sure! When you confirm your reservation,
you will receive an email message.
You can find instructions on how to cancel or reschedule
on that message, but please do that early and try not to
cancel at the last minute.

### What will be the difference between in-person and Zoom meetings?

Given the social-distancing guidelines,
our in-person meetings will not be truly interactive.
Please understand that I will not be able to walk around
in the classroom and work on problem with you closely
due to the restrictions.

### Where can I find lecture videos

They will be listed on the Blackboard course page
and/or the course page on my own website.

### How can I get to know my classmates?

You are all invited to a Microsoft teams team
just for this course.
Your classmates and myself are all in this team.
Log in and say Hi!

### Why are some material not available through Blackboard?

In our current situation, it is crucial that
technology will be on our side.
Our learning management system must be reliable
and easy to use.
We don't need anymore troubles.
In the past year, my colleagues and I have had
technical problems with Blackboard system frequently.
That is not acceptable.
I will try to maintain some material on Blackboard,
but it won't always be successful.

Our legal department told me not to describe Blackboard
as something designed by idiots,
but it suffices to say that after years using Blackboard,
I have not observed evidences suggesting any functional brain cells
are involved in the creation of this piece of software.

To ensure the success of my students,
I must look elsewhere.
You where find most of the digital material through 
[Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/)
and my personal course page.

### How to access "Teams"?

You should already be added to the teams for my course,
so you should have received an invitation that contains
detailed instructions.

You should also be able to simply go to
<https://teams.microsoft.com/>
and log on use your __AUM credentials__.

If you have a smartphone,
I suggest that you also download the mobile app,
which are quite convenient to use.

### What can I do on "Teams"?

You can...

* chat with me and your classmates in real time.
* initiate video or voice calls.
* Read (some) lecture notes
* Take surveys/quizzes

It's just like Facebook, except it's not a complete waste of time.
